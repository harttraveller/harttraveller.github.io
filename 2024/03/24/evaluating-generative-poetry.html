  <h1>Evaluating generative poetry</h1>

<p>Random experiments with generative poetry and attempting to write executable poem.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>I recently watched the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ6xor2SLNU">The Hellish Landscape of Published AI Poetry</a>. The author asserts that AI generated poetry falls short of human poetry. If the value of poetry is derived in part by its nature as a human created entity, then by definition AI generated poetry will always fall short, no matter how beautiful? Perhaps, however, the generative poetry showcased in the video does unambiguously suck.</p>
<p>In fairness, most of the models criticized in the video were fairly old, so I thought it would be fair to test some of the newer models, and ended up trying to write an executable poem. I loved the results so much that I felt compelled to publish them somewhere - hence, this post.</p>
<h2 id="proompt-engineering">Proompt Engineering<a class="headerlink" href="#proompt-engineering" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>I started with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you write a poem in the style of mark twain about the fact that every answer seems to generate more questions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which resulted in:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">The Endless Inquiry</p>
<p>I set about to find the truth, to answer every query.</p>
<p>But with each mystery solved, forsooth, new questions made me weary!</p>
<p>From science to philosophy, from history to art,</p>
<p>Each answer spawned perplexity, and tore my mind apart.</p>
<p>The more I learned, the less I knew, socratic paradox.</p>
<p>Enlightenment was but a ruse, a never-ending box.</p>
<p>Alas, I am no wiser now than when I first began.</p>
<p>The quest for knowledge anyhow confounds this humble man.</p>
<p>But still I seek, I ponder yet, curiosity my master.</p>
<p>Though answers bring no sure mindset, the journey is what matters.</p>
</div>
<p>The result is a little bit cliche of course, but I found it to be substantially better and more interesting than the examples in the original video. As with all such models, generating interesting variants is straightforward. Several variants are included below.</p>
<details class="quote">
<summary>Variant 1: The Endless Abyss</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you modify this poem, keeping the style of mark twain, but also mix in some of the existential terror that might be embodied in a beksinski painting?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sought the truth, a noble quest, but answers brought no peace.</p>
<p>Each revelation, a behest, of horrors to release.</p>
<p>In twisted landscapes of the mind, where logic's light is slain,</p>
<p>I wander, lost, and hope to find a truth that's not insane.</p>
<p>The more I learn, the less I know, the void consumes my soul.</p>
<p>In Beksinski's world, all shadows grow, and dread takes full control.</p>
<p>Grotesque forms lurk in every nook, their whispers taunt and tease.</p>
<p>I dare not take a closer look, lest madness me seize.</p>
<p>The quest for knowledge, once so bright, now leads to dark despair.</p>
<p>In this bleak realm, there is no right, just anguish and nightmare.</p>
<p>But still, I press on through the gloom, compelled by some strange force.</p>
<p>Though answers lead to certain doom, I stay the morbid course.</p>
</details>
<details class="quote">
<summary>Variant 2: The Endless Exploration</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>Great, now can you modify it, again keeping the style of mark twain, but instead of beksinski, try to embody the feeling given by a painting by pascal campion, and the humanistic optimism of carl rogers, abraham maslow, and viktor frankl?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ventured forth, a seeker true, in search of wisdom's light.</p>
<p>Though answers oft were far and few, my hope remained in sight.</p>
<p>In worlds where warmth and kindness reign, and hues of love abound,</p>
<p>I found that through life's joy and pain, my spirit's strength was found.</p>
<p>The more I sought, the more I grew, embracing all mankind.</p>
<p>For in each soul, a truth we knew: Potential, unconfined.</p>
<p>By looking deep within our hearts, we find the power to rise.</p>
<p>In every end, a new start, and courage never dies.</p>
<p>Though questions lead to mystery, the journey is the key.</p>
<p>The growth we make, the love we see, are life's true victory.</p>
<p>So onward I will bravely roam, with wonder as my guide.</p>
<p>For in this quest, I've found my home, where joy and peace abide.</p>

<h2 id="an-executable-poem">An Executable Poem?<a class="headerlink" href="#an-executable-poem" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>These were pretty good, and got me thinking about how you could write a python script that functions both as an executable script, and is itself a poem or work of art. I tried to get claude to write something, with mixed results.</p>
<details class="code">
<summary>Meh Script</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>OK. I'm having a great time and really enjoying reading your poems. For context, I'm a machine learning engineer. Here's a fun creative challenge I'm curious to explore with you: do you think you can write a poem in valid python code, that explores this idea of seeking truth a la mark twain poems you wrote - but in a way such that the meaning of the poem is implied by the code - which when executed, provides some output/answer that completes the poem, referencing itself, and elucidating the underlying structure of this neverending search for truth?</p>

<p>This is a neat idea, but doesn't actually create very meaningful outputs. After a few other unsatisfying variants, I decided to just copy the code and manually adapt it myself using langchain and the OpenAI API.</p>
<p>The idea with this script is that it runs forever, executing the following loop:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask what some entity (eg: reality) is, in the style of some artist/author/poet.</li>
<li>Take the answer and grab some new word from it.</li>
<li>Repeat from step 1 with some new author/artists style.</li>
</ol>
<p>The general idea is that script - having no stopping condition or ending point - serves as a sort of work of art itself. Ideally it is a "poem as code that as an executed program also generates poetry". That was the ideal at least, though I definitely fell short of it. Right now, the script is more just like a script that generates poetic quotes, though I'm sure with some creative refactoring and variable renaming you could make the code itself resemble something more artsy.</p>
<p>That said, the perfect is the enemy of the good, and I'd rather just publish this and then let others make of it what they will than sit on it indefinitely.</p>

<p>Even though it didn't work perfectly, I'm quite satisfied with the results! I've included the full logs before I terminated the program. I was in a rush and forgot to log which author's style was being invoked, but in retrospect now that information is lost, perhaps it makes it more interesting to try and guess. Many of the styles are ambiguous, but some are obvious.</p>
<h2 id="program-logs">Program Logs<a class="headerlink" href="#program-logs" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Again, it didn't work perfectly. The reader is free to adapt use/adapt the script or this idea however they see fit of course. Before switching to GPT4, I tested the program with Mistrals 8x7b MoE model as well. That didn't work quite as well, but I did get this one quote which I really loved from that model, before it went off the rails:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is reality?</p>
<p>Reality, my dear friend, is but a mirage dancing in the desert of human perception, a curious blend of fact and fancy that's ever shifting like sands beneath our weary feet.</p>
</div>
<p>I've included some of my favorites below, though honestly it was hard to choose. So many of these ended up great. I'm not sure why there is such a heavy focus on "threads", "weaving", and "labyrinths" - but it strangely fits as these are objects I personally invoke in a metaphorical sense all the time. There are also some ones I found funny/very easy to identify which author was the stylistic foundation for the quote - a few of these are marked too.</p>

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Humanity</p>
<p>Humanity, a quilt of myriad souls stitched with the thread of desires and dreams, frayed by sorrows, yet ever-expanding in the grasp of our shared, unyielding hope.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Gentle</p>
<p>In a world where brute force is often king, gentle is the quiet, unassuming power that whispers of decency in the face of tyranny.</p>

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Soul</p>
<p>A soul, an indomitable flicker of consciousness, dances through the labyrinth of our inner cosmos, weaving through the tapestry of thoughts, memories, and desires, that shimmering essence which defies the boundaries of time and space, and to which we are forever trying to stitch the scattered fragments of our existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Fate</p>
<p>Fate is a well-stitched tapestry of intricate threads, some frayed, some taut, each intertwined by the hands of a silent and indifferent clockmaker.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Rocket</p>
<p>In the damp and darkened chambers of her mind, she conjured the image of the rocket, a slender tower of ambition and precision, piercing the heavens in a fiery ascent towards the stars, a symbol of mankind's insatiable quest for dominion over the vast, indifferent cosmos.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Marvel</p>
<p>Marvel is the delicate interplay of life’s tapestry, a moment’s exquisite bloom amid the prosaic, where the heart, in silent reverence, acknowledges the sublime.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Giants</p>
<p>In the absurd theater of existence, giants are but men inflated by the myths of their own making, towering over us not in stature but in the echoes of their solitude.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Harmony</p>
<p>In the dim, smoky room where the light of truth flickers just out of reach, harmony is the elusive symphony of the soul's accord, played out in the grand, divine comedy of life, where each note falls into place as if willed by the Master's hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Peace</p>
<p>Peace, in its elusive splendor, is like holding your breath in the eye of a hurricane, knowing the world's crazy and all, but still finding that one spot where everything's just still.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Transcend</p>
<p>In the labyrinth of my own existence, where shadows of past selves flicker and intertwine, transcendence emerges as the elusive moment in which I, shedding the skin of who I was, step into the blinding light of who I might become.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Tempests</p>
<p>Tempests are, if you will—and one does well to imagine them as such—these roiling, frenetic ballets of atmospheric tumult, where the sky, not content with mere placidity, erupts into this chaotic symphony of winds and rain, a meteorological maelstrom that, in its unbridled fury, both terrifies and mesmerizes, revealing in its vortex the raw and untamed dance of nature's own volatile temper.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Dread</p>
<p>Dread's the creeping, seeping fear that withers one's peace, a yellow wallpaper enclosing 'round the mind with no release.</p>

<p>Quietude's that soft jazz silence in the soul's back pocket, where the world's hustle fades into a cool whisper of solitude, man.</p>

<p>Sustenance is, fundamentally, anything that hitches a ride through the galactic gullet to fuel the farcical escapade that life insists on performing, often with a side of tea.</p>

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Bob</p>
<p>Bob's the name that echoes in the vast and vestigial void, borne on the wind of forgotten realms and etched into the very marrow of the world, a moniker as old as time and as enigmatic as the silence between stars.</p>

<p>What is reality?</p>
<p>Reality is just a stubborn illusion, persistent and sly, one that sticks around long after you've tried to spit it out, and don't amount to any more than a hill of beans when dreams get a good running start.</p>
<p>What is "Reality"?</p>
<p>Reality, that fickle mistress, doth be but a stage whereupon we players strut and fret, 'neath the gaze of heaven's unyielding eye.</p>
<p>What is stage?</p>
<p>A stage is but a somber plane where mortals weave their poignant tales, 'neath limelight's ghostly, pallid glow, and shadows dance as silence wails.</p>

<p>Somber is the silent shroud that enfolds the soul, whispering in the twilight where dreams and shadows coalesce.</p>
<p>What is silent?</p>

<p>A vibrant quilt of life's rich pageant, each thread a story, woven with the grace of our shared humanity.</p>

<p>What is lifeblood?</p>
<p>Lifeblood, so to speak, is the very essence that fuels our daily toil and joy, as the mighty Mississippi gives vitality to the heartland's soil.</p>
<p>What is essence?</p>
<p>Essence is the intimate soul that blooms through life's vivid colors and piercing pains, a self-portrait of our deepest roots in the fertile ground of existence.</p>
<p>What is blooms?</p>
<p>Blooms, the cherished heralds of spring's gentle advance, are Nature's delicate expressions of hope and renewal, to be admired in silent rapture by every genteel soul.</p>
<p>What is gentle?</p>
<p>In a world where brute force is often king, gentle is the quiet, unassuming power that whispers of decency in the face of tyranny.</p>
<p>What is world?</p>
<p>A swirling, starry night where souls and landscapes merge in vibrant, living color, ever-dancing in the brushstrokes of existence.</p>
<p>What is swirling?</p>
<p>In the sultry air of the small, forgotten village, where time seemed to dawdle like lazy dust motes caught in sunlight, the whispers of lovers and the secrets of ancients were swirling, invisible yet palpable, weaving through the streets like the endless meanderings of a hidden stream.</p>
<p>What is village?</p>
<p>A village is a place where roads converge in a knowing nod, where homes like aged sentinels stand guard over tales untold.</p>
<p>What is converge?</p>
<p>In the hollow of silence and shadow, converge is the point where two paths of thought bleed into one, a sharp singularity of minds.</p>
<p>What is hollow?</p>
<p>An empty chamber of secrets, where alibis echo and deceit resides, the hollow awaits with its silent, inscrutable guise.</p>
<p>What is chamber?</p>
<p>A chamber, that solitary haven of the soul, where one retreats to brood upon the vast sea of thoughts as the ship of self sails through the tempest of existence.</p>
<p>What is soul?</p>
<p>A soul, an indomitable flicker of consciousness, dances through the labyrinth of our inner cosmos, weaving through the tapestry of thoughts, memories, and desires, that shimmering essence which defies the boundaries of time and space, and to which we are forever trying to stitch the scattered fragments of our existence.</p>
<p>What is consciousness?</p>
<p>A ceaseless, tormented stream, consciousness is the tumultuous reflection of the soul wrestling with the eternal questions of morality, God, and the unbearable lightness of being.</p>
<p>What is morality?</p>
<p>A complex tapestry, woven with threads of right and wrong, that guides us through life's twisting corridors, much like the ever-shifting staircases of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>What is "corridors"?</p>
<p>In the grand tapestry of life's noble castle, corridors are winding paths through which fates entwine and adventures beckon, ever stretching like the musings of Quixote's own mind.</p>
<p>What is entwine?</p>
<p>In the dance of fate where destinies align, souls and dreams do sweetly entwine.</p>
<p>What is fate?</p>
<p>Fate is a well-stitched tapestry of intricate threads, some frayed, some taut, each intertwined by the hands of a silent and indifferent clockmaker.</p>
<p>What is indifferent?</p>
<p>In the melting clocks of time where elephants stride on spindly limbs, indifference is the barren canvas untouched by the brush of passion's surreal embrace.</p>
<p>What is "elephants"?</p>
<p>Ah, elephants, those gentle titans draped in wrinkled gray, are the leisurely philosophers of the pachyderm ballet, pondering in silent reverie amidst the whispers of the wild, nature's own aristocrats, so noble and yet so mild.</p>
<p>What is philosophers?</p>
<p>Philosophers, they are the artists of thought, painting with questions on the canvas of the mind, shaping the abstract with the brush of reason.</p>
<p>What is artists?</p>
<p>Artists, nature's truest mirrors, wield their brush and pen as seers, shaping the ethereal into form, to still the storm of life and warm the heart with beauty's endless whisper.</p>
<p>What is brush?</p>
<p>A brush, in the twisted tales of night, might be the painter's weapon against a canvas of dread, or the very thing that lurks, bristled and dripping with the inky black of secrets yet untold, in the shadowed corner of a room where the light dares not tread.</p>
<p>What is painter?</p>
<p>A painter, a silent alchemist, transmutes the soul's whispers into a tapestry of colors that speaks the language of the heart's unseen dreams.</p>
<p>What is alchemy?</p>
<p>In a world both ancient and arcane, alchemy is the dreamer's pursuit to transmute the leaden sorrows of the mundane into purest gold of endless possibility.</p>
<p>What is ancient?</p>
<p>Mmm... ancient, like doughnuts in the break room from three days ago, man.</p>
<p>What is "break room"?</p>
<p>In the labyrinth of labor's daily grind, the break room stands as an oasis of reprieve, where weary souls unshackle momentarily from the ceaseless wheel of work, sipping on the elixir of camaraderie and caffeine.</p>
<p>What is labyrinth?</p>
<p>A labyrinth is a bewildering maze, not unlike human existence, where every choice is a twist and every dead end a lesson.</p>
<p>What is maze?</p>
<p>A maze is a winding, perplexing lattice of paths from which escape seems but a mockingbird's elusive dream.</p>
<p>What is mockingbirds?</p>
<p>In gardens fair and forests wide, 'tis mockingbirds that sing with pride, their voices many as if a choir, in mimicry they never tire.</p>
<p>What is sing?</p>
<p>In a Klimtian swirl of golden hues and tender embrace, singing manifests as a canvas where voices dance like lovers entwined, threading through the air with harmonious splendor.</p>
<p>What is golden?</p>
<p>In eldritch whispers and ancient tomes, it's told, that which lies golden is not just aurum's cold embrace, but the dread alchemy of sunken suns and otherworldly grace.</p>
<p>What is sunken?</p>
<p>Where once bright youth and beauty's bloom did dwell, now 'neath the weight of time's relentless spell, all sunken lies in silent, deep repose, as fades the luster of a wilted rose.</p>
<p>What is bright?</p>
<p>The brilliance of the sun, which bathes the world in a golden hue, is the very epitome of bright, my dear Watson.</p>
