> [!note]
> This project has been archived. I made some changes to the theme specific to my usecase which I think would reduce its utility for others. The linked repository still has functional code, however, and can be used to add hotkeys and "copy code" buttons to your site, among other features.

## Overview
The objective of this project is to create a minimal theme for this obsidian publish sites.

## Details
The [GitHub](https://github.com/harttraveller/minatheme) repository has more documentation and information on using the theme. Minor adjustments will be made here and there, but it will probably be moved to the done category in a few months.
