In some versions of Maslows hierarchy of needs, reproduction is included on the base layer. More detail is required however.

We'll use the chart referenced [here](https://simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) wherein reproduction is classified as a physiological need.

According to [this](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-4136760#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20basic%20requirements%20of%20nutrition%2C%20air%2C%20and%20temperature%20regulation%2C%20physiological%20needs%20also%20include%20shelter%20and%20clothing.%20Maslow%20included%20sexual%20reproduction%20in%20this%20level%20of%20the%20hierarchy%20as%20well%2C%20since%20it%20is%20essential%20to%20the%20survival%20and%20propagation%20of%20the%20species.) article, reproduction is considered a physiological need because it is required for the species to propogate.

I think this is a bad definition; attributable to the lack of specificity.

Let's first define a 

because it really ought to at a minimum delineate between the physiological needs of an individual, and the survival dependencies of a species. Though there are also several other differentiations that ought to be made, in order to more effectively answer the question posed in the title of this page.

## Differentiations
- sex vs. reproduction
- need vs. want
- species vs. individual
- physiology vs. psychology

## Is sex an individual need?



## Reproduction: Individual Physiological Need

In order to answer the question of whether reproduction is a physiological need for a given individual, we must further define what a "need" actually is.

For instance, if we defined a "need" as a form of longing, and the fulfillment of that need as the satiation of that longing, then we might consider reproduction, or more specifically: sex, the fulfillment of a human need, then in some contexts I think it would be apt to classify it as a psychological need, and not a physiological one.

I say: "in some contexts" because naturally the proposition that sex fulfills a human psychological longing depends on the individual human, and depends on the longing.

In respect to the individual human part, we could consider the population of asexuals, who may have no such longings for sexual contact with other humans. For these individuals, sex would not meet the definition of a psychological need.

On the other hand, we ought to also add further definition to longing. For instance, if the longing in question is a longing for sexual gratification, then it may be that masturbation is sufficient to satiate that longing, and fulfill the need - in which case "sex" would not be a psychological need, but rather; "activities of sexual gratification" would be a psychological need, of which "sex" is a subtype. 

If instead we consider human connection and love to be a psychological need, then arguably masturbation is now insufficient. We would, however, need to refine our definition of "human connection and love" - given there are plenty of non-sexual expressions of these qualities. In order to positively make the statement that:

> Given the definition of a need as a form of longing, and the fulfillment of the need as the satiation of that longing, sex is a human psychological need.

We would therefore need to further state that there is such a thing as: romantic human connection and love for which sex is a critical component.

However, plenty of people would take the position that romantic human connection and love does not necessarily require sex, and so we would have to suppose (restricting the population sample once again) - that there is a type of romantic human connection and love that does require sex, and that this is our focus here.

As a thought experiment, let's suppose all of the above is true. This still suggests that sex is only a psychological need in a portion of the population. Thus, the answer to the original question would be: "it depends on who you are".

Now let's revisit the definition of "need", as I think defining need as a longing does a disservice to the word need. A better definition for "need" might be:

%%A property, criteria, or environmental condition which is required for the survival and continued existence of the entity that holds the need.%%

%%In the interest of specificity, given none of us can live forever, we ought to also define "survival", and simply state that "to survive" means "to maintain a state of homeostasis that enables the processes of life to continue up to the mean expected death time of a given individual within a species, ceteris paribus".%%

By this definition, sex is not a human psychological, nor physiological need. There are innumerable examples in the past and present, which demonstrate this to be the case; the primary example being monks throughout various religions with doctrines of abstinence.

In respect to the invididual, we might conclude that:

1. Sex is not a 'need'.
2. Sex is a 'want' in a majority of the population.

At most, sex is an `OptionalDependency` that depending on context, conditionally satisfies human wants.


We would also need to differentiate between the act of having sex, and the act of having children.
