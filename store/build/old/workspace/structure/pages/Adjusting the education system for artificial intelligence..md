## Description

In this article we posit a potential solution to address academic integrity concerns introduced by the influx of new AI text generation tools, while also improving the education system in America.

> [!abstract]- Key Points
> - The origin of written text is uncertain due to new AI tools.
> 	- This is destabilizing to the school system.
> - The issue is not AI, but misplaced objectives in education.
> - The solution is to restructure the system.
> - We should stop trying to teach students specific subjects and instead:
> 	- Inspire them to learn of their own volition.
> 	- Give them the freedom to pursue what they see fit.
> 	- Provide resources to facilitate the learning process.
> - If we do not restructure the system, this will damage the current generation attributing to a  disincentive to engage introduced by the risk ones genuine effort is delegitimized through an accusation that AI was used, even when it was not.
> - Specific policy recommendations are included.
> - A preliminary proposal for a new system design is included.

## Context

I think it would fair to say we have reached a point where AI generated text (AGT) is often difficult or impossible distinguish from human generated text (HGT). This doesn't mean they are always indistinguishable, just that in some cases they are.

> [!clarify]- Clarifying Model
> To add clarity to this point: suppose we had a function $Q$ which could accept any arbitrary written work, and return a "quality" metric between 0 and 1.
> 
> > [!tangent]- Metric Subjectivity
> > Of course, such a metric is debatably impossible. Most would agree, however, that "War and Peace" is a higher quality work than a sample of randomly generated words. It follows that in some abstract sense we can imagine a continuum between these two items representing a "quality" score.
> 
> Now suppose we take the set of AGT, and the set of HGT, and graph the respective quality distributions together. Perhaps it would look something like this.
> ![[text generation quality distribution.svg|300]]
> At the moment, writing books on par with "Godel, Escher, Bach" or "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" is beyond the capabilities of AI. However, your average high school report on the meaning of "The Catcher in the Rye", falls firmly in the area of uncertainty (AOU). This is destabilizing to the classical model of education - and will only become more so as the AGT distribution continues to shift right, and the AOU grows.

## Detection Tools

To address this, tools have emerged which claim to be able to detect whether or not something is written by AI. This is acutely ironic, but it is worth asking: do the tools work?

No. I imagine that in most cases attempting to tell whether an assignment is generated by AI with any degree of accuracy is marginally more feasible than trying to read the words from the ashes of book.

> [!tangent]- Accuracy
> As an aside: while I use the word "accuracy" here for the sake of convenience, the metric itself is generally a poor one (absent context).
> 
> For instance, suppose I was trying to create a classifier to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors. If my classifier *always* predicted benign, and I tested it on a dataset that had 999 benign tumors and 1 malignant one, then my classifier would be right 999 times out of 1000 and thus would have a 99.9% accuracy - but it would be functionally useless.
> 
> Basically: if you see an AI company promising "99.9% accuracy", you shouldn't necessarily trust them. They may be telling the "truth", but their product might also suck, so be sure to ask them what the [F-score](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/F-score) of their model is. People in STEM will be familiar with this idea, but for folks in non-technical fields I figured I'd point this out.

Take for instance the [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11ha4qo/gptzero_an_ai_detector_thinks_the_us_constitution/) included below, in which an AI detection service overwhelmingly marks the US constitution as having been written by AI.

<img src="https://i.redd.it/1dnljilbgkla1.png" style="width:400">

Granted, a single example is not rigorous proof, so I would encourage any teachers who read this article to put the work *they* have written into the tools they are using to judge their students, and see how well they stack up.

> [!tangent]- Feasible Detection Methods
> There are technically at least two ways the tools could actually work, but the first is not feasible and the second would be easy to bypass. I am certain neither of them have been implemented as of my writing this.
> 
> > [!tangent]- Social Media Context
> > There are other statistical methods in the context of social media for detecting AI generated text, which rely on the engagement patterns of a given account, but that is outside the domain of this article.
> 
> **Method 1**
> OpenAI gives teachers access to all the prompts they have received, and all user data. Furthermore, the NSA gives teachers access to certain databases that may or may not exist. Whenever a teacher gets an assignment, they feed the assignment text into an information retrieval system. It's arbitrary, but lets say a doc2vec model trained on all ChatGPT responses, which can return chats in the latent space similar to the query chat embedding.
> 
> Results are compared word for word (as who knows, a student could have changed some stuff up) and if there is a sufficiently high similarity, then the NSA database is queried to see if the email associated with that account is also used by the student. Students could try to circumvent this by using a temporary email service, which is why the NSA would have to be on board.
> 
> Of course, OpenAI would never release that data, and the NSA has more important things to do, so this solution is infeasible. Besides, it would be an understatement to say that using surveillance tools meant for terrorists on students submitting book reports is not *exactly* in line with American principles.
> 
> **Method 2**
> In strategic spots in the generated text, characters are replaced identical looking but [spoofed](https://onlineunicodetools.com/spoof-unicode-text) unicode characters following an identifiable pattern. This would require the approval of the company producing the AI, however, as they would need to implement this. Besides the fact they are financially incentivized to *not* do this, it would also be trivial to unspoof any text.

## The Problem

In order to identify the solution, we must first identify the true problem, which in this case *is not the AI*. This is conjecture - but it seems self-evident to me that the fact there is a market for AI generated text detection tools is a symptom of an underlying disease called: "misplaced objectives". 

Specifically, the lack of clarity in respect to the objectives of the education system (and the dependencies for these objectives) has resulted in a modus operandi wherein making sure students don't "cheat" is more important than making sure students actually learn.

> [!note]- Blame and Responsibility
> In my humble opinion, blame is a pointless exercise that wastes energy better spent on finding solutions. Responsibility for the state of affairs does not lie on the shoulders of teachers, school administrators, the government, parents, students, AI companies, or any other entity.
> 
> If we absolutely had to assign the responsibility to something, it would be the unfathomably complex network of cause and effect built from the flows of information and energy through a societal machine that encompasses *all* of the prior entities, and many more not listed here.

## The Objectives

Establishing [[blueprint for effective operation|objectives]] is a critically important precursor to any engaging with any task. Accordingly, we ought to ask: what is the purpose of the education system? Depending on the perspective you take, there are at least three possible answers. 

> [!note]- Incomplete List
> Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient for our purposes. The question is: given our stated objectives, how to we modify the system so that it naturally carries itself to these objectives, instead of trying to drag it there without restructuring it in any meaningful way?

### Perspective: Society

From the perspective of society the purpose of the education system is to create economically productive citizens with the ability maintain the system, and who are capable of contributing to technological progress and cultural evolution.

> [!question]- Defining Society
> Imagine for a moment that "society" is a living organism comprised of people, computer systems, physical infrastructure, and so on. We might use the word "culture" to refer to the software this organism uses to drive its decisions, with culture itself consisting of narratives, archetypes, shared values, axiomatic perceptions of the nature of reality, etc.

### Perspective: Cynical Individuals

From the perspective of cynical individuals, the education system serves as a mechanism for class mobility, and a gateway to higher earning potential.

### Perspective: Idealistic Individuals

From the perspective of idealistic individuals, the education system serves to help human beings flourish, realize their true potential, and equip them with the tools they need to make something meaningful out of their lives.

## Approach

I'm going to make the case that prioritizing the third - and most optimistic perspective - will not only allow the education system to fulfill *all* the objectives more effectively, but it will *also* address academic integrity concerns caused by AI. Furthermore, I'm going to make the case that we *must* do this, lest we incur damage to this generation that would take decades to recover from.

The specific damage comes from the disincentive to actually write anything.

### Flow and Learning

As a rule of thumb: when people are deeply interested in what they are doing they are vastly more effective and productive than those who don't care or who are bored. I would estimate that the effective learning rate of engaged individuals in a state of flow is several orders of magnitude greater than bored individuals who feel compelled to learn to serve the interests of others - whether that is their parents, teachers, society, or any other entity.

> [!tangent]- Personal Experience
> I strongly disliked math, and by extension programming. Today, I absolutely love math, and spend ~80% of my free time coding. I think the reason I disliked it was that it was always just a boring "thing" one had to do, in order to pass some vague criteria for success set by entities I wasn't aware of at the time, and whose reasoning I didn't understand. In essence: it felt entirely meaningless.
> 
> Later, a shift in my model of the world occurred. I realized that math was a gateway into a deeper understanding of the world, both philosophical, and pragmatic. I found that as one begins to think in mathematical terms, it is almost as though a clarifying structure is superimposed upon the world that allows one to answer questions hidden just below the surface of what is visible to the naked eye.
> 
> In respect to programming, the interest was initiated by experiences wherein I needed it to do something incredibly interesting, and upon succeeding, I felt this profound curiosity about what *else* I could do if I expanded my understanding. The causal factor in this case was not that I was forced to do something, but rather that I genuinely wanted to do it. 
> 
> To be clear: I don't think everybody should go into STEM. I *do* think everybody should spend their life focusing on what they are passionate about, and realize their full potential as a human being.

If people are engaged, if they care about what they are doing, and if they have a spark of passion, curiosity, and drive for meaning, they will learn faster and be disproportionately more productive. Accordingly, the goal of the school system shouldn't be primarily to *teach* students, but rather to inspire the passion to *learn* - and give them the necessary tools to do so.

### Competitive Motivation


## Policy Recommendations


## Proposed System Design


Identify passion, and cultivate it - allowing it to grow. As opposed to attempting to have people  conform to an overly rigorous structure.


Instead of teaching them *subjects*, teach them how to learn, and live, and adapt to life
- psychological support

inspire passion, cultivate with experiences




---

## Solution

TODO: add specific policy and restructuring diagrams etc here

- This is conjecture, but I think that 
	- Further conjecture: I'm betting if we did this, economic productivity would vastly accelerate.
	- Further conjecture: as automation takes off, adopting an approach like this may be *necessary*.
		- After all, LLM tools are already kind of the death of homework. Enforcing policy the old way is going to become impossible soon, and doubling down on the policy of induced stress will fail as it becomes easier and easier to circumvent that stress via tools like ChatGPT.

### Specific Recommended Adjustments

- Get rid of homework
- positive and inspiring experiences, wonder, meaning
- Psychological coping mechanisms, mindfulness, CBT
- Restructure classes from a learning experience, to a competitive experience
- Role of teachers shifts from conveying information to the student, to inspiring the student, monitoring the students learning process, adjusting it when necessary, and providing them resources to facilitate their own learning path.





### Research Required

Most of the learning infrastructure is *already* in place. It has been addressed by private entities.

- Create ontology of learning resources and tracking system

When students aren't learning, the solution should *not* be to penalize them, but to help them explore alternative paths that may be more interesting to them, which they would be able to deeply and willfully engage with of their own volition.

Of course, there will be edge cases. While it it my opinion that no one is predestined to a certain fate, or if they are, the chaotic nature of our universe makes it impossible to predict - some people probably have an overwhelmingly high probability of becoming truck drivers. This brings me to the next point: becoming a truck driver is absolutely fine.

Though this would be more difficult, another optimal change would be to reallocate social reward and status from profession, or financial wellbeing, from societal perception of an individual, to an individuals perception of themself. 

- Federal government works out deal with brilliant


## Conclusion


- Flow
- Competition
- Focus on cultivating passion and curiosity, and providing a framework, and resources, to explore that curiosity and passion, and streamline the process


## Prescriptions

Get rid of homework, no exceptions. Instead of giving students homework, give them suggestions which are crafted to be *genuinely* interesting, and the resources to act on those suggestions.

The goal should **NOT** be to *teach* students. It should be to:

1. Ignite a passion to learn within them through
	1. Positive experiences
	2. a framework of positive incentives
2. Give them a structure to explore on their own terms
3. Give them the resources they need to explore whatever, and however they see fit

We are moving into a world where the old system will no longer work. In fact, we have already arrived. If we try to cling to it, this will only do more damage to students, as they are further disincentivized to learn on the basis that if they create anything original, or actually engage, they run the risk of having their work delegitimized on the suspicious that it was created by an AI.

Why would any student in their right mind engage in such a context? I wouldn't.

There is a solution, and while the specific steps I've laid out in this article may not be exactly what is required, I think they point in the right direction.

What is required is that everyone involved is willing to take a leap of faith, and trust that by giving up some measure of control, and giving students more freedom to choose their own path in life, the system can persist.

If we try to cling to the old system, we will destroy ourselves and deal a debilitating blow to this generation which may take decades to recover from.

If you happen to be a spook though, don't worry - control doesn't need to be completely relinquished. 






If you imagine reality as vast plain

In order to maintain a competitive edge with geopolitical adversaries, we need to be able to embrace technology and work with it, instead of shunning it and attempting to cling to our old ways. If we cannot evolve, we will be forced to evolve eventually anyways, and we will suffer all the more for attempting to forestall the inevitable.


## Notes

## Question

So the question is, how do we do this?

## Proposals
- Create an ontology of all required basic knowledge, and represent it in a computationally tractable interface that allows students to select their own paths through the network.
- This isn't just for math, optimally students would be allowed, or even incentivized to pursue many different paths experimentally to decide what is the best fit.
- Also, psychological coping classes, such as meditation, CBT, etc, are probably a good idea.
- Finally, creating meaningful experience tailored to incentivize active passion about the world is probably the most important thing.
- Add projects at key milestones that are tailored to be maximally interesting to students.
- Restructure the psychological pressure to succeed
	- There should still be pressure to succeed, but that pressure should have its roots in an internal will, or volition to understand the world
	- As opposed to the current standard: external pressure introduced on the basis of the implied threat of violence and the satiation of the ego
- Clarification for implied threat of violence and ego
	- If I (don't/do) do well in high school
		- I'm worth (less/more) than others (implied psychological pain/reward) and
		- I (won't/will) get into a good college
		- If I don't get into a good college
			- Society will (judge me/glorify me) for this and
			- (No one will/everyone will want to) hire me
			- If no one hires me
				- I starve, and can't live
			- Otherwise I make lots of money, have lots of stuff, and people will want to be like me
	- ^ this entire loop should be deconstructed
		- people would be better served if they were able to pursue what they truly cared about without fear, ego, or implied violence
		- furthermore, people who care about what they're doing are vastly, possibly orders of magnitude more productive than people who don't
			- so this really should be a hard case to make to "the system", given economic growth is in "the systems" interest



- we can and should use AI, and in fact we should embrace it.
- For instance, using AI to monitor student progress and automatically suggest new potential pathways if they are not demonstrating a high degree of engagement in certain areas could be a solution

I suggest we split the traditional role of the teacher into x roles:
- personal mentor
- Psychological therapist
- System engineer
- System administrator, monitors progress

TODO: create a blueprint of system and org chart

- ontology of education and learning pathways
- use private enterprise - we don't need to reinvent the wheel, we just need to use existing private tools
- Use known systems for learning, eg: flashcards and spaced repetition.
- Accept that not everyone needs to learn everything
- adopt challenge, project, and competitive dynamics in classroom 


- the system I've proposed would optimally be tested in a few specific areas, so A/B testing could be performed and the structure could be refined through time.


- the current system is adversarial, the teachers are pitted against the students, as the teachers are the gatekeepers for grades
- This should be restructured so teachers are mentors.
- The adversarial nature does not need to be removed, but it should be student-student competition, as opposed to student-teacher conflict.


Question: Can I integrate this into AAA psychological engineering experiments to set a baseline?
