#present/active 

I strongly hold that if one wants to create change in the world, or in oneself, there is a general blueprint one should follow. It consists of two groups.

## Group 1: Objective Establishment

In the first group we figure out where we want to go. This consists of the following components.

1. Identify abstract objectives
2. Convert abstract objectives into discrete objectives
3. Create measurable success criteria for discrete objectives
4. Identify the dependencies required to fulfill success criteria
5. Create metrics to evaluate progress on dependencies

*Notably, it is critically important one has at an absolute minimum a set of abstract objectives, and better yet, discrete and quantifiable objectives and accompanying feedback systems to measure progress. If one does not have these, one is subject to the unpredictable whims of the chaos, or worse: the misperception of reality.* 

## Group 2: LPE Loop

In the second group, we iteratively loop over the following steps, and continue indefinitely until we arrive at our objectives.

1. Learn
2. Plan
3. Execute

To clarify this group, imagine reality as a vast space of potential possibilities. There is a location in this space in which you are a world renowned astronaut, and another where you are cook at Red Lobster, and another where you died long ago. You traverse the space by way of the decisions you make.

In respect to "learning": the first thing you must do if you are to traverse the space effectively, is ensure you are aware of the general layout of the space, and that you understand how your decisions effect your movement through the space. After all, the decisions we make often have unintended effects.

In respect to "planning": one must chart a path throughout the space, given ones understanding of it, that leads to ones objectives.

In respect to "execution": finally, it is necessary to execute that plan, and return to step 1 to update ones model of the world whenever things to not work as intended, or the objectives shift.
