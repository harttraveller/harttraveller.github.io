I've delayed uploading stuff for some time due to information security considerations. I expect most of what I write/create will be wrong, useless, or unintentionally redundant. Ideally, there will be *something* that is original or interesting, but it's hard for me to tell what that will be beforehand; hence - uploading (almost) everything.

Unfortunately one cannot have ones cake and eat it too; it's somewhat difficult to share ones thoughts honestly while also avoiding revealing information about oneself. I figure that given that A) I will be dead relatively soon, B) I'm not particularly important, and C) life as a whole is accelerating, and the window for me to contribute something may be closing - the possible utility of anything I might contribute crosses the threshold of personal cost in respect to information transparency.
