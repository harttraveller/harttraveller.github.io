# main
A property of an [[definition.ACS|ACS]] in a wherein it both exists in a low-entropy state, and has the ability to continue to exist in a low entropy state.

# note
## absurdity of implied consequences of definition
Suppose we consider a ship to be an ACS. This isn't entirely unreasonable - after all a ship is a configuration of matter in a low entropy state. It is certainly a system and it is certainly complex. Whether or not a ship is "adaptive" is another question, and depends on what we consider the ship to actually be, and how we define "adaptive". One potential definition is embedded below.

![[definition > adaptive#main]]

If we consider the ship to be the physical ship, then it is possible that in some edge cases it would be adaptive, when human engineers replace components of the ship. This seems to be a stretch however.

What I find less of a stretch, although I expect it would seem *more* absurd to most - is that the "ship" is actually the information associated with the ship, and we can conceive of this organism as being adaptive - living on, within, and across the minds of human beings. The ship does evolve, and it evolves within the minds of people - the physical manifestation of the ship is just the proving ground that enables calibration of the feedback signal between the living entity of the ship, and the physical matter making up its instantiation.

*As a tangential aside: suppose you were a ship engineer. If this were the case, a substantial portion of your brain would probably be devoted to ships, and accordingly the information associated with some arbitrary "ship" would be represented on and across the neurons in your mind. To state these neurons (and you) are alive should not be controversial. If I were to say that the fact that the information of the ship exists on your mind, it evolves on your mind (and when you discuss ship design plans with your fellow engineers), and thus is by proxy the ship is alive - would probably be controversial. You might respond that while you are alive, the ship is just a non living image that exists in your mind. I might respond that if we removed all such non living images from your mind, you would cease to exist - because your sense of existence is defined precisely by the confluence of non-living images which you perceive to be separate from yourself. You might respond that while you are alive, this is an emergent property which comes about by way of the interaction of these images within the framework that is you. Of course, at this point we have diverged from the question of "life" into "consciousness".* 

With that said, the physical ship still contains information associated with the ship, and could be considered "alive" in some very abstract sense. Where the strangeness is introduced is that the ship would only be alive - subject to the existence of humans who could reintegrate the information associated with the ship.

To illustrate the absurdity, imagine that an old ship is locked in the arctic ice, and it has to be abandoned by its crew. Several hundred years pass, and over the course of time, global human civilization collapses and we regress back to primitive societies with little to no advanced technology. One day, explorers from a post-civilization tribe discover this ship, and are able to reverse engineer it and reintegrate the information associated with the ship - thus bringing it back to "life". We might say that in a sense the ship "survives".

On the other hand, if humanity had gone extinct, then the ship would not have survived. Indeed, the ship would have died the moment the last human died, bringing the probability of its reintegration with humanity, and thus its survival - to zero.

If this were true, then in the interim period where the ship is lost and humanity exists, but our fate is uncertain, is the ship alive or dead? I think one would have to say it exists in a superposition of both states, given this status can only be assigned retroactively given the knowledge of future events which have not yet occurred.

## dictionary definition
**noun**
- the state or fact of continuing to live or exist, typically in spite of an accident, ordeal, or difficult circumstances: the animal's chances of survival were pretty low | figurative : he was fighting for his political survival.
	- an object or practice that has continued to exist from an earlier time: his shorts were a survival from his army days.
