The Gini coefficient is a term in economics that is used to describe income equality across a society, where 0 represents a perfectly egalitarian society, and 1 represents a totalitarian society where one person has all of the income/wealth/capital etc. A clarifying graph from [physics.ucla.edu](https://www.physics.ucla.edu/~chester/GINI/index.html) is included below.
