# main
A property, criteria, or environmental condition which is required for the survival and continued existence of the entity that has the need.

# note
## on survival

In the interest of specificity, given none of us can live forever, we ought to also define "survival".

![[survival#main]]

There is nuance to this definition, however. Oxygen is necessary for human survival, but oxygen is plentiful, and humans still die. Accordingly, if we had to define the elements necessary for survival - by proxy the "needs" of a given entity - would oxygen be a "need". Of course, oxygen *is* a need, but also, it does not enable the continued existence of the entity that has the need indefinitely. It follows that to reconcile this difference, we would have to add some kind of temporal specificity to the definition of survival - one which factors in the life span of a given ACS against the mean life span of its peers. Perhaps I'll get around to this later.
