# main
A property of an entity in reality which allows it to undergo change that facilitates an increased ability to lower local entropy within the entity, or future entities derived from the present entity.

## on continuing to exist
Initially I was tempted to add something about an entities ability to continue to exist to this definition, but that incurs a few problems. Let's suppose an entity is the information associated with the entity, and not the physical matter (which we necessarily must given the high exchange rate of physical matter and energy between any entity and its environment through time).

If this is true, then we might imagine that for an entity to "continue to exist", we would have to be able to sample the information associated with the entity as some time $T_0$ and some later time $T_1$ - and upon comparing the two, find that the information associated with the entity is the same, or at least very similar.

The issue is that if we apply this definition in the context of adaptivity, where adaptivity is defined as: "continuing to exist", we can immediately find innumerable examples in which this is not the case throughout evolutionary history of life. Indeed it appears that in order to be adaptive, you must necessarily possess the ability to *not continue to exist* - albeit in a nuanced way. After all, there is plenty of life we originate from, which was adaptive, and it led to us, but no longer exists.

Thus, to reconcile this dilemma (as I can tell) we have two choices:

1. We constrain the definition of adaptivity within entity-dependent temporal boundaries.
2. We abandon the notion that adaptivity reflects the continued existence of any entity.

On point 1, we might be able to force the definition of adaptivity to work with "continued existence" if we constrain the temporal bounds for the existence of an arbitrary entity within a domain in which the entity is not expected to evolve beyond some threshold beyond which we would consider it a different entity, but is expected to evolve to an extent that we can say that it has undergone the process of evolution, and is thereby adaptive.

The issue with this is essentially that setting such a threshold is subjective, and I can't imagine any way to approach establishing the threshold in a discrete and objective manner. 

Furthermore, the temporal bounds we choose would also be highly context dependent. For instance, if we considered the evolution of the [peppered moth](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Peppered_moth_evolution) our temporal bounds might be on the order of hundreds of years. On the other hand if we considered the evolution of some kind of deep sea crab that mates once every four decades, moves slower than a snail, and has looked the exact same for 100 million years, our temporal bounds would have to expand many orders of magnitude.

Accordingly, I don't think there is sufficient rigor here to consider "continued existence" as part of what is adaptive.

We might say then that while death is not adaptive, the transmutation of an entity into a new form (in the process erasing the old form) is adaptive?

First, it is debatable whether death is adaptive, and this question rests really on the entity we're focusing on. Considering there may be multi-entity crossover within a single perceived entity across the abstraction layers of reality, the death of one entity $E$ may be adaptive for greater super-entities that encompass $E$. I digress; this idea is explored in more detail elsewhere on the graph.

If we are to assign this sort of "transmutation" definition to adaptivity, then what metric is our transmutation measured by?

We could say: "fitness to the entities environment" and leave it at that. I've pondered this though, and it seems to be a somewhat circular definition. After all, if you say there is some entity $E$, which undergoes change through time, in order to... continue to exist? *Except that it does not continue to exist and by definition must not continue to exist as its environment changes*. OK - so there is some entity $E$, which undergoes change through time, it does not continue to exist, but it instead becomes new entities, and we are measuring some made up metric of adaptivity on the entities ability to not continue to exist effectively, but transmute into new forms which "can not continue to exist" more effectively?

Perhaps we measure the entities ability to replicate itself? If this were true, plenty of entities in reality which we do not consider adaptive on the basis of intuition would meet the definition of adaptivity. Indeed, waves on the surface of the ocean would be adaptive given this definition.

In summary - applying continued existence in this context seems to be nonsensical; using it  basically boils down to: "there are things in reality, and as reality changes, those things change" - which is such a broad definition that we might as well apply it to anything in reality.

Which means we are left with no definition at all. Or at least, given the line of reasoning in the notes section of this page to this point - no definition. The best metric I can think of to measure adaptivity by is the definition stated in the main section of this page, namely: entropy.

The full definition might be: A property of an entity in reality which allows it to undergo change that facilitates an increased ability to lower local entropy within the entity - at the expense of its environment.

The caveat being that perhaps someday life will find a way to circumvent the laws of thermodynamics, and we will beat chaos once and for all.
