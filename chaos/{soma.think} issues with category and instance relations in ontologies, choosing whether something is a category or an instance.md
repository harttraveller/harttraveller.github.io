**Intuition**
Probably instances should be entities which cannot be decomposed further without losing the property of being the entity they are.

For instance, `css` is a subcategory of `style sheet language`, but suppose we say that the following code snippet is an X(?) of the category `css`.

```css
{
	position: absolute;
}
```
What is X?
- instance of?
- subcategory of?

Is there anything which is a instance of this snippet?
