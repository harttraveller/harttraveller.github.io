Does being a member of the species homo sapiens make you a person?

Immediately we find our first issue -> how do we answer the question when there are answers, but they diverge and there is no consensus?

For instance:
- Some people would say that brain dead members of the species homo sapiens are not instances of the category person. Some would say they are.
- Some would say that psychopathic war criminals are not instances of the class person. Some would say they are.

Already we have arrived at a lack of consensus.

Suppose that we said - for the sake of convenience - that a person is a member of the species homo sapiens.

Is Van Gogh a person? Well, he *was* a member of the species homo sapiens, but now he is just a memory in the collective cultural consciousness of homo sapiens.

Yet if I asked the average person on the street in New York: "is Van Gogh a person?" Probably many of them would say: "Yes, of course!" or at least some of them would correct me and say: "He was a person, he's dead now.".

Either answer suffices and implies that then perhaps we should delineate between people who *are* and people who *were*. That's fine, but presumably then both of these categories are subcategories of a supercategory "person".

What are the criteria for *that* category?
