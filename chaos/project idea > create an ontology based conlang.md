either from the ground up or by adapting english, with the objectives of:
- gaining a deeper understanding of the possible ways language can express itself
	- making sure it covers the possible space of necessary actions, entities, etc would be a good way to express this
- consolidating redundant turns
- ensuring rigor and specificity
- def should have we[you and I] - we[humanity] - we[this company] formal elucidation to eliminate context requirements, in some form or another
	- basically ensure there is a formal "type" system for referents, entities, etc
		- cause metaphorically right now languages are mostly python, and it would be nice if they could be rust
- also, for fun, if the [[? > negative numbers don't exist]] project yields fruit, having the normal numeric system have no negative numbers could be cool
	- this is probably a bad idea though, and should probably only be implemented as an option and not a requirement
		- really, ideally - the conlang is both formal, precise, and expressive enough to capture everything that english (etc) can capture (and more? - otheelings maybe but likely not possible)
		- also, it should probably be as close to english as possible, while resolving the issues with english, in order to reduce the barrier to entry
- introducing huffman-esque encoding for term length and complexity after consolidating and minimizing words could be good
- and hell, why not clicking and whistling in a spoken version as signifiers in key places?
- main objective:
	- minimize speaking and writing time while maximizing conciseness
	- structure the language in a way that forces the user to be highly concise, does not allow spin, and does not allow for subjective interpretation, and ideally makes people who try to engage in annoying and manipulative linguistic tactics look like asses by way of the inherent structure of the language
- ideally natively integrating formal logic into the structure of the language would be a good idea too, though it would also need to allow for bayesian reasoning, and the expression of more complex thoughts as well
- also need to account for contexts, or "abstract lenses", and rigorously define these as well, as a statement that is true in one context may be false or undetermined in another

# utility scratchpad
- would be useful in any case where being:
	- efficient
	- concise
- primary utility in:
	- military
	- emergency and disaster response
- but also many other domains
	- perhaps it would be useful for news media?
		- it would probably be *good* for the news to use something like this
		- but they would probably heavily resist it, even if everyone was already fluent
	- tangential thought: are the consumers of mainstream news actually looking for the truth, or are they just looking for something to believe?
		- probably highly variable based on the new outlet and individual in question, and context
- 

# design scratchpad
- one place to start: remove "highly", "somewhat", "not very", etc
	- could use numeric system (not this, but analogous)
		- not very concise -> concise[1]
		- somewhat concise -> concise[2]
		- concise -> concise[3]
		- highly concise -> concise[4]
- also, remove redundancy
	- eg: all the following terms are the same, can be consolidated
		- **highly** X -> X[4]
		- **very** X -> X[4]
		- **extremely** X -> X[4]
