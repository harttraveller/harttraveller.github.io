Intuitively I feel like Plutonium would be a good fit.</p> Why Plutonium? <p>To maximize the effect of time dilation, we need to get the atom as close to the singularity as possible. Accordingly we would want to minimize the atomic radius. I used this chart to check the atomic radius of varying elements. Whether this is relevant in such extreme conditions, I do not know. On the other hand, we also might want to maximize the mass of the atom, in order to maximize the computational capacity of the system; source.</p> Quantum Computer Precedent <p>Femtocomputers would differ substantially from modern quantum computers. We aren't simply executing Shor's algorithm; rather we are attempting to simulate a mind (or preferably, many minds), within at most a single atom. As such, I doubt we can make inferences about femtotech - fictional standalone systems - on the basis of the features of real quantum computers. The latter must be cooled to near absolute zero to work, require cumbersome physical support infrastructure, and are only useful when many qubits have been entangled with each other (I think(?) - don't quote me on that).</p>"},{"location":"2023/02/01/escaping-the-heat-death-of-the-universe.html#storage-estimates","title":"Storage estimates","text":""},{"location":"2023/02/01/escaping-the-heat-death-of-the-universe.html#femtocomputer-storage","title":"Femtocomputer storage","text":"<p>Instead of calculating a specific value, I've opted to estimate upper and lower bound values. The specific process is included at the bottom of this section. The lower bound of storage capacity is \\(30.5 \\space bytes\\), or around seven UTF-8 characters. As for the upper bound... If we took every grain of sand on earth, and put the entire internet into each one - we could call that volume of data one \"internet sand\", or \\(IS_0\\) for short. If we took every grain of sand on earth, and put an \\(IS_0\\) in it, we could call that volume of data \\(IS_1\\). The upper bound storage limit for the femtocomputer would be able to store just over two copies of \\(IS_1\\), with a capacity of ~\\(1.6 \\times 10^{61} \\space bytes\\).</p> Upper &amp; Lower Bound Calculations <p>We'd need to decide whether we're going to assume the volume of the atomic radius will be considered a storage/compute medium, or whether we are just considering the atomic nucleus. Of course, I don't know which is the case, but to be conservative (though, really, I don't know what is and isn't a conservative estimate here), I selected just the atomic nucleus.</p> <p>Furthermore, let's assume that the absolute upper bound of information density is \\(1 \\space bit\\) of information for every discrete cubic volume with dimensions of \\(1\\) Planck length. Let's assume the lower bound is \\(1 \\space bit\\) per proton or neutron. This means that the lower bound on the storage capacity of the femtocomputer is just the number of protons plus the number of neutrons, or \\(94+140=244 \\space bits\\) or \\(30.5 \\space bytes\\). The upper bound calculation is slightly more complex.</p> <p>For simplicities sake we're treating the neutron and proton radius as the same. Also rounding the Planck length; given the speculative nature - sig. figs prob don't matter here.</p> <ul> <li>Pu Protons = \\(94\\)</li> <li>Pu Neutrons = \\(150\\)</li> <li>Proton Radius = \\(8\\times10^{-16} \\space m\\) </li> <li>Neutron Radius = \\(8.3\\times10^{-16} \\space m\\) -&gt; ~\\(8\\times10^{-16} \\space m\\)</li> <li>Planck Length = \\(1.616\\times10^{-35} \\space m\\) -&gt; ~\\(1.6\\times10^{-35} \\space m\\)</li> </ul> <p>First we need to calculate the total volume available to us in the nucleus - I'm using \\(m^3\\) to standardize stuff. We'll assume they are spherical, thus the volume of the nucleus is:</p> <p>\\(244 \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\space m) ^{3} = 5.2 \\times 10^{-43} \\space m^3\\)</p> <p>Each cubic Planck volume stores \\(1\\) bit:</p> <p>\\(\\frac{(1.6 \\times 10^{-35} \\space m)^{3}}{bit} = 4.1 \\times 10^{-105} \\space m^3/bit\\) </p> <p>Because the Planck length is so small, we'll treat each one as a voxel. Accordingly we can simply divide these two figures into each other to find the theoretical upper bound:</p> <p>\\(\\frac{5.2 \\times 10^{-43} \\space m^3}{4.1 \\times 10^{-105} \\space m^3/bit} =\\) ~\\(1.28 \\times 10^{62} \\space bits \\space =\\) ~\\(1.6 \\times 10^{61} \\space bytes\\)</p> <p>The result of this calculation is ~\\(1.6 \\times 10^{61} \\space bytes\\) - this is a lot of capacity to say the least. For context, the market intelligence firm IDC estimates that the internet will be 175 zettabytes by 2025. One zettabyte is \\(10^{21} \\space bytes\\). Dividing these figures into each other tells us our hypothetical femtocomputer has an upper bound storage limit of ~\\(1.6 \\times 10^{40}\\) internets - in 2025. </p> <p>Of course, given that the calculation is based on an entirely speculative chain of reasoning, it has very little pragmatic purpose besides serving as a waypoint for an absolute upper bound which will probably never be reached.</p> <p>Note that even though the margin between the lower and upper bound would better be described as a chasm - this does not impact our analysis.</p> <p>Finally, for the grain of sand calculation, I used this estimate, and applied the 2025 internet figure.</p>"},{"location":"2023/02/01/escaping-the-heat-death-of-the-universe.html#brain-storage","title":"Brain storage","text":"<p>According to this paper by Thomas Bartol et al. the human brain can store around \\(4.7\\) bits of information per synapse.

Increasing this figure does a disservice to our plan to save humanity, as it means we can fit fewer people on each femtocomputer.

<p>Reality, that fickle mistress, doth be but a stage whereupon we players strut and fret, 'neath the gaze of heaven's unyielding eye.</p> <p>What is stage?</p> <p>A stage is but a somber plane where mortals weave their poignant tales, 'neath limelight's ghostly, pallid glow, and shadows dance as silence wails.</p> <p>What is somber?</p> <p>Somber is the silent shroud that enfolds the soul, whispering in the twilight where dreams and shadows coalesce.</p> <p>What is silent?</p> <p>In the profound stillness of the night, when all the hustle of humanity lay hushed, silence reigned supreme, as if it were a sovereign draped in the velvet cloak of darkness, whispering secrets to the stars.</p> <p>What is \"humanity\"?</p> <p>Humanity, a quilt of myriad souls stitched with the thread of

story, diverse yet unified in the grand design of existence.</p> <p>What is \"tapestry\"?</p> <p>A vibrant quilt of life's rich pageant, each thread a story, woven with the grace of our shared humanity.</p> <p>What is vibrant?</p> <p>Vibrant is the lifeblood of the day, pulsing with the relentless clarity of a matador's final stand.</p> <p>What is lifeblood?</p> <p>Lifeblood, so to speak, is the very essence that fuels our daily toil and joy, as the mighty Mississippi gives vitality to the heartland's soil.</p> <p>What is essence?</p> <p>Essence is the intimate soul that blooms through life's vivid colors and piercing pains, a self-portrait of our deepest roots in the fertile ground of existence.</p> <p>What is blooms?</p> <p>Blooms, the cherished heralds of spring's gentle advance,

quiet, unassuming power that whispers of decency in the face of tyranny.</p> <p>What is world?</p> <p>A swirling, starry night where souls and landscapes merge in vibrant, living color, ever-dancing in the brushstrokes of existence.</p> <p>What is swirling?</p> <p>In the sultry air of the small, forgotten village, where time seemed to dawdle like lazy dust motes caught in sunlight, the whispers of lovers and the secrets of ancients were swirling, invisible yet palpable, weaving through the streets like the endless meanderings of a hidden stream.</p> <p>What is village?</p> <p>A village is a place where roads converge in a knowing nod, where homes like aged sentinels stand guard over tales untold.</p> <p>What is converge?</p> <p>In the hollow of silence and shadow, converge is the point

silent, inscrutable guise.</p> <p>What is chamber?</p> <p>A chamber, that solitary haven of the soul, where one retreats to brood upon the vast sea of thoughts as the ship of self sails through the tempest of existence.</p> <p>What is soul?</p> <p>A soul, an indomitable flicker of consciousness, dances through the labyrinth of our inner cosmos, weaving through the tapestry of thoughts, memories, and desires, that shimmering essence which defies the boundaries of time and space, and to which we are forever trying to stitch the scattered fragments of our existence.</p> <p>What is consciousness?</p> <p>A ceaseless, tormented stream, consciousness is the tumultuous reflection of the soul wrestling with the eternal questions of morality, God, and the unbearable lightness of

Hogwarts.</p> <p>What is \"corridors\"?</p> <p>In the grand tapestry of life's noble castle, corridors are winding paths through which fates entwine and adventures beckon, ever stretching like the musings of Quixote's own mind.</p> <p>What is entwine?</p> <p>In the dance of fate where destinies align, souls and dreams do sweetly entwine.</p> <p>What is fate?</p> <p>Fate is a well-stitched tapestry of intricate threads, some frayed, some taut, each intertwined by the hands of a silent and indifferent clockmaker.</p> <p>What is indifferent?</p> <p>In the melting clocks of time where elephants stride on spindly limbs, indifference is the barren canvas untouched by the brush of passion's surreal embrace.</p> <p>What is \"elephants\"?</p> <p>Ah, elephants, those gentle titans draped in wrinkled gray, are the leisurely philosophers of the pachyderm ballet, pondering in silent reverie amidst the whispers of the wild, nature's own aristocrats, so noble and yet so mild.</p> <p>What is philosophers?</p> <p>Philosophers, they are the artists of thought, painting with questions on the canvas of the mind, shaping the abstract with the brush of reason.</p> <p>What is artists?</p> <p>Artists, nature's truest mirrors, wield their brush and pen as seers, shaping the ethereal into form, to still the storm of life and warm the heart with beauty's endless whisper.</p> <p>What is brush?</p> <p>A brush, in the twisted tales of night, might be the painter's weapon against a canvas of dread, or the very thing that lurks, bristled and dripping with the inky black of secrets yet untold, in the shadowed corner of a room where the light dares not tread.</p> <p>What is painter?</p> <p>A painter, a silent alchemist, transmutes the soul's whispers into a tapestry of colors that speaks the language of the heart's unseen dreams.</p> <p>What is alchemy?</p> <p>In a world both ancient and arcane, alchemy is the dreamer's pursuit to transmute the leaden sorrows of the mundane into purest gold of endless possibility.</p> <p>What is ancient?</p> <p>Mmm... ancient, like doughnuts in the break room from three days ago, man.</p> <p>What is \"break room\"?</p> <p>In the labyrinth of labor's daily grind, the break room stands as an oasis of reprieve, where weary souls unshackle momentarily from the ceaseless wheel of work, sipping on the elixir of camaraderie and caffeine.</p> <p>What is labyrinth?</p> <p>A labyrinth is a bewildering maze, not unlike human existence, where every choice is a twist and every dead end a lesson.</p> <p>What is maze?</p> <p>A maze is a winding, perplexing lattice of paths from which escape seems but a mockingbird's elusive dream.</p> <p>What is mockingbirds?</p> <p>In gardens fair and forests wide, 'tis mockingbirds that sing with pride, their voices many as if a choir, in mimicry they never tire.</p> <p>What is sing?</p> <p>In a Klimtian swirl of golden hues and tender embrace, singing manifests as a canvas where voices dance like lovers entwined, threading through the air with harmonious splendor.</p> <p>What is golden?</p> <p>In eldritch whispers and ancient tomes, it's told, that which lies golden is not just aurum's cold embrace, but the dread alchemy of sunken suns and otherworldly grace.</p> <p>What is sunken?</p> <p>Where once bright youth and beauty's bloom did dwell, now 'neath the weight of time's relentless spell, all sunken lies in silent, deep repose, as fades the luster of a wilted rose.</p> <p>What is bright?</p> <p>The brilliance of the sun, which bathes the world in a golden hue, is the very epitome of bright, my dear Watson.</p> <p>What is Watson?</p> <p>Watson, a labyrinth of circuits and code, mirrors the minotaur of our own intellect, where every query is an echo in its endless, algorithmic library.</p> <p>What is minotaur?</p> <p>Minotaur, the labyrinthine offspring of Pasipha\u00eb's unnatural love, horns crowning its man-bull visage, broods in Knossian shadows, yearning for Athenian tributes to sate its monstrous appetite.</p> <p>What is Pasipha\u00eb?</p> <p>In nature's vast and mystic lore, Pasipha\u00eb stands as mythic queen, entwined by love's bewildering spell to birth the labyrinthine Minotaur, where human and beastly scenes convene.</p> <p>What is mystic?</p> <p>In the soft, fading light of day, I find myself pondering the nature of that which eludes the grasp of our understanding, a quiet, persistent enigma, mystic in its whispering allure.</p> <p>What is enigma?</p> <p>An enigma, O baffling challenge to the soul, that cryptic dance of meaning veiled in riddle's clothes, unceasingly beckoning the curious spirit with its whispered secrets through the cosmos!</p> <p>What is challenge?</p> <p>A challenge, that fierce spark of unknown futures, is the rocket fuel propelling us toward the stars of our wildest dreams, ever igniting our spirits with the restless fire of possibility.</p> <p>What is rocket?</p> <p>In the damp and darkened chambers of her mind, she conjured the image of the rocket, a slender tower of ambition and precision, piercing the heavens in a fiery ascent towards the stars, a symbol of mankind's insatiable quest for dominion over the vast, indifferent cosmos.</p> <p>What is precision?</p> <p>Precision's the needle-eye through which unerring truth does thread, a meticulous dance of atoms where not a single step is shed.</p> <p>What is needleeye?</p> <p>A slender passage for thread, the eye of a needle beckons like a gate through which we must all, stripped bare, endeavor to pass.</p> <p>What is passage?</p> <p>Passage, that elusive migratory bird in the skies of time, flutters its diaphanous wings through the hallowed halls of memory, where each whisper of its beating heart echoes the infinite cadence of moments lost, regained, and cherished in the amber of our own existence.</p> <p>What is bird?</p> <p>A feather'd marvel, by divine design, with wings to soar and freedom to define.</p> <p>What is marvel?</p> <p>Marvel is the delicate interplay of life\u2019s tapestry, a moment\u2019s exquisite bloom amid the prosaic, where the heart, in silent reverence, acknowledges the sublime.</p> <p>What is delicate?</p> <p>Delicacy, an invisible insect fluttering between the fingers of existence, always evading the grasp of understanding.</p> <p>What is insect?</p> <p>An insect, with its tiny form, is nature's small artist, whose minute brush paints the world with life's vibrant hues and ceaseless industry.</p> <p>What is tiny?</p> <p>In the vast, bustling expanse of God's grand creation, where giants tread and empires rise, it is the minuscule, nearly invisible speck, trembling on the whims of fate, that evokes the curious charm of the infinitesimal, the truly tiny.</p> <p>What is giants?</p> <p>In the absurd theater of existence, giants are but men inflated by the myths of their own making, towering over us not in stature but in the echoes of their solitude.</p> <p>What is men?</p> <p>Men are a mosaic of fleeting moments, each piece a story of joys and sorrows, shaping a complex portrait of humanity within the merciless frame of time.</p> <p>What is mosaic?</p> <p>In a dance of shattered tales and tinted glass, mosaic weaves an ancient whisper, a patterned truth where fragments find their place within the dream of a whole.</p> <p>What is whisper?</p> <p>A whisper, soft-spun breath's caress, sculpting silence into subtle secrets, a voice's tender chisel upon the ear's marble.</p> <p>What is sculpting?</p> <p>Sculpting is the tender defiance of shaping stone to breath, bearing witness to the silent strength within.</p> <p>What is defiance?</p> <p>Defiance, like a lone oak standing firm against the relentless gales, is the indomitable spirit that refuses to bow to the crushing weight of conformity.</p> <p>What is oak?</p> <p>Oak, in its stoic grandeur, is the slow and certain arbiter of time, its rings the archive of unspoken histories, its branches the outstretched hands of a wizened elder, offering refuge to the sky.</p> <p>What is arbiter?</p> <p>En el juego de la vida, \u00e1rbitro es quien con justicia y mesura entre disputas humanas dicta y gu\u00eda, cual estrella en la noche oscura.</p> <p>What is justicia?</p> <p>In the divine order's cosmic dance, justicia is the steadfast scale, where each soul's fate by God's own glance is weighed with truth that shall not fail.</p> <p>What is cosmic?</p> <p>In the vast, velvet void where silent stars dance with divine indifference, cosmic is the ethereal enigma, an infinite waltz of worlds unseen, a grandeur so profound it whispers to our souls in the language of the sublime and the sacred.</p> <p>What is \"divine\"?</p> <p>In counterpoint of cosmic score, divine the harmony of spheres, where notes celestial do align, and music of the heavens clears.</p> <p>What is harmony?</p> <p>In the dim, smoky room where the light of truth flickers just out of reach, harmony is the elusive symphony of the soul's accord, played out in the grand, divine comedy of life, where each note falls into place as if willed by the Master's hand.</p> <p>What is \"comedy\"?</p> <p>A laughter-dappled garden in bloom, comedy dances 'neath a lighthearted sky, where troubles melt like morning dew and joy is painted in every hue.</p> <p>What is garden?</p> <p>A sanctuary where whispers of the earth's deepest secrets are cradled in petals and leaves, serenaded by the wind's hushed lullabies.</p> <p>What is \"petals\"?</p> <p>Fragile whispers of nature's tender hands, they are the colored dreams of waking flora, dancing to the whims of the zephyr's breath.</p> <p>What is whispers?</p> <p>In dulcet tones, a zephyr's speech, a secret's tender, silent breach.</p> <p>What is zephyr's?</p> <p>In the world of Greg Heffley, a zephyr's just a fancy word for wind that'd mess up my hair on school picture day.</p> <p>What is GregHeffley?</p> <p>In tempestuous sonatas of youth, a boy named Greg Heffley plays, his life's symphony in diary notes profoundly sways.</p> <p>What is sonatas?</p> <p>In dim-lit rooms where pianos dwell, a sonata weaves its magic spell, with starts and stops and softs and louds, it dances free, away from crowds.</p> <p>What is \"pianos\"?</p> <p>In rooms where silence once reigned as a sullen king, pianos, with their ivory and ebony crowns, awaken stories in the hush, fingers dancing over keys like lovers reunited, whispering to the heart in the language of longing.</p> <p>What is ivory?</p> <p>In silent whispers of light, ivory emerges, a pale treasure born of the gentle tusk, embodying serene purity in Vermeer's tranquil gaze.</p> <p>What is emerges?</p> <p>In the quietude of dusk's embrace, what emerges is the shape of the world itself, all enshadowed and enwombed in the ancient and ever-looming twilight of being.</p> <p>What is quietude?</p> <p>Quietude's that soft jazz silence in the soul's back pocket, where the world's hustle fades into a cool whisper of solitude, man.</p> <p>What is jazz?</p> <p>Jazz is the soul's confession in melodic whispers, where each note unfurls like a dark velvet petal in the shadowed rooms of eternity, a sensual hymn to the night's own heartbeat.</p> <p>What is eternity?</p> <p>Eternity stretches, a horizon unmarred by the passage of suns, the quiet heart of time where moments dissolve, as if life's fierce urgencies were but shadows cast by an unblinking, still star.</p> <p>What is \"unmarred\"?</p> <p>Unmarred is a spotless spot, a perfect thing where flaws are not!</p> <p>What is spotless?</p> <p>In the quietude of dawn, before the world stirs, lies the spotless canvas of existence, untouched by the day's impending intricacies.</p> <p>What is dawn?</p> <p>Dawn is the silent herald of day's promise, whispering to the world the return of light, life, and the eternal hope that peace might reign as the sun ascends its throne anew.</p> <p>What is peace?</p> <p>Peace, in its elusive splendor, is like holding your breath in the eye of a hurricane, knowing the world's crazy and all, but still finding that one spot where everything's just still.</p> <p>What is \"hurricane\"?</p> <p>Es el aliento feroz de un tit\u00e1n desatado, que en su furia despliega el manto de la tormenta y en su danza salvaje, desgarra el velo azul del cielo en su llanto.</p> <p>What is tormenta?</p> <p>In tempest's wrath, where nature's might unrestrained doth roar, tormenta is the storm's fierce heart, a tumultuous uproar.</p> <p>What is might?</p> <p>Might is that clenched fist in your stomach, the roar of your shadow self, screaming through your veins when the world tries to tell you 'no.'</p> <p>What is screaming?</p> <p>A piercing cry that rends the veil of silence, as if the tortured soul's despair were given voice in the shrouded night, echoing the agony that Frankenstein's creature felt amidst the shadows of an unfeeling world.</p> <p>What is shrouded?</p> <p>In the labyrinthine folds of the human psyche, lies shrouded the enigmatic dance of our deepest fears and desires, scarcely glimpsed by the flickering candle of consciousness.</p> <p>What is folds?</p> <p>Intricacies of fabric or life, they crease and contour, bending to time's insistent press, as our own souls do, in divine and earthly bind.</p> <p>What is \"fabric\"?</p> <p>A woven shroud of existential threads, intertwining in silent screams of color, binding the chaos of the soul beneath the surface of the world.</p> <p>What is existential?</p> <p>Existential is the raw pulse of human consciousness confronting the vast silence of the universe, a search for meaning in the echoing chambers of our own fleeting lives.</p> <p>What is search?</p> <p>Search is a labyrinthine quest within the infinite library of Babel, where every path is a narrative etched in the sands of time, endlessly branching towards the elusive Aleph of truth.</p> <p>What is Aleph?</p> <p>Aleph is the point at which everything, the universe, the souls, and the endless possibilities of life converge, a mystical moment where past, present, and future are one.</p> <p>What is universe?</p> <p>The universe, a grand and mystic expanse where myriad stars weave the somber tapestry of night, whispers to the human soul of its own insignificance amidst the eternal vastness.</p> <p>What is grand?</p> <p>Grand is the noble struggle of the soul, which against the crushing tides of fate doth boldly hold its own, unyielded.</p> <p>What is noble?</p> <p>Noble is the quiet strength in choosing to be kind in a world that often forgets the soft power of empathy.</p> <p>What is strength?</p> <p>Strength lies within the quiet heart that endures, steadfast as the ancient hills, undaunted by the capricious tempests of fate.</p> <p>What is endures?</p> <p>In the crucible of time, it is the unyielding truth of our shared human condition that endures, outlasting the brittle facades of our own making.</p> <p>What is \"crucible\"?</p> <p>A melting pot where trials blaze, forging strength from our toughest days.</p> <p>What is pot?</p> <p>Pot, often a vessel of clay or metal, cradles within its curved embrace the sustenance of a home, a symbol of the mundane that whispers of shared meals and quiet continuity.</p> <p>What is sustenance?</p> <p>Sustenance is, fundamentally, anything that hitches a ride through the galactic gullet to fuel the farcical escapade that life insists on performing, often with a side of tea.</p> <p>What is ride?</p> <p>A ride, a damn slipstream of life, booze and smoke, where the tires burn the street, and your soul clings to the wheel.</p> <p>What is booze?</p> <p>Booze, that insidious weaver of dreams and unraveler of proprieties, under whose warm, deceptive glow the staid world loosens its stiff corset, inviting both the whispers of liberation and the spectres of regret.</p> <p>What is insidious?</p> <p>A snark of silence, sly and hideous, creeps quiet as a bandersnatch, weaving whispers, most perfidious, in shadows where the plots are hatched.</p> <p>What is bandersnatch?</p> <p>It's a snatching, catching creature of nonsense, lurking in the jabberwocky's shadowed nonsense, a figment frumious in Carrollean myth.</p> <p>What is creature?</p> <p>In the labyrinth of existence, a creature is but a whisper of fur and bone, entwined in the enigma of life's persistent, patterned poem.</p> <p>What is patterned?</p> <p>In life's grand tapestry, so deftly woven, every thread's a pattern, fate's own token.</p> <p>What is woven?</p> <p>A tapestry of silent moments, intertwining threads of being and becoming, is woven in the loom of time, endlessly in the hands of the unseen weaver.</p> <p>What is \"intertwining\"?</p> <p>Intertwining, that intricate dance of fates where separate strands of will and representation weave together, manifests the profound interconnectedness of all things, revealing the underlying unity that Schopenhauer discerns as the essence of the world.</p> <p>What is Schopenhauer?</p> <p>In the somber tapestry of human thought, Schopenhauer weaves a thread of profound pessimism, asserting life's futility amidst the relentless will's blind striving.</p> <p>What is weaves?</p> <p>Weaves are the crafted crowns of synthetic or human strands, woven into the tapestry of one's natural hair, a sanctuary of self-expression and metamorphosis in the urban sprawl of identity.</p> <p>What is \"sanctuary\"?</p> <p>A hallowed haven from the harrowing, a silent sanctum for the soul's sojourn, whispering walls of solace that echo with the ethereal, 'tis sanctuary where hearts repose 'neath the pall of Poe's eternal prose.</p> <p>What is hallowed?</p> <p>On urban canvas, where shadows play, hallowed is the silenced voice that graffiti's truth will say.</p> <p>What is graffiti?</p> <p>A city's whispered shout, ink blooms on concrete skin\u2014a silent rebellion.</p> <p>What is rebellion?</p> <p>Rebellion is the alluring whisper of discontent that dances through the jazz-filled night, a restless echo of dreams deferred amidst the glittering facade of a generation's gilded despair.</p> <p>What is discontent?</p> <p>Discontent, a restless specter roaming through the gilded halls of joy, whispers of greener fields beyond our sight, where dreams ungrasped in silent yearning lie.</p> <p>What is roaming?</p> <p>Roaming is the unbridled dance of signals in search of an embrace, across invisible borders, beneath the vast sky of our shared stories and whispered secrets.</p> <p>What is \"signals\"?</p> <p>In the tapestry of life, \"signals\" are the whispers of destiny, subtly guiding us through the labyrinth of fate with their invisible threads.</p> <p>What is guiding?</p> <p>In the mannered tales of the Decameron, where wit and wisdom intertwine, guiding is the gentle hand of Fortuna, leading souls through the labyrinth of life's divine design.</p> <p>What is Decameron?</p> <p>The Decameron, a veritable tapestry of tales, is a tome wherein Boccaccio, with the finesse of a master wordsmith, weaves a hundred stories told by a bevy of Florentines seeking refuge from the plague's dark shadow in the verdant embrace of the countryside.</p> <p>What is countryside?</p> <p>La campi\u00f1a es un suspiro de verde donde el alma se alza en vuelo, entre susurros del viento y el eterno beso del cielo.</p> <p>What is suspiro?</p> <p>In the sigh of the evening, suspiro whispers the heart's deepest yearnings, a breath cradled between longing and loss, much like a petal adrift on the silent river of time.</p> <p>What is evening?</p> <p>Evening is the gentle closing of the day's eyelids, a whispering pause between the light and the night's deep sigh.</p> <p>What is closing?</p> <p>In the hush of suburbia's dusky eve, a chapter's gentle end whispers through the fluttering pages of our daily being, a bookstore's light dims.</p> <p>What is bookstore?</p> <p>A bookstore is a reservoir of the silent voices that speak loudest when read, a sanctum where souls are eternally woven into the tapestry of narratives and truth.</p> <p>What is reservoir?</p> <p>A reservoir, a tranquil glass reflecting Heaven's own face, where stored the lifeblood of the earth in Nature's gentle embrace.</p> <p>What is Heaven?</p> <p>Heaven is a dream of peace, where the laughter of all children echoes without the shadow of fear, and the sky is not marred by the smoke of war, but clear and bright as the hope in my heart.</p> <p>What is laughter?</p> <p>A visceral burst of life's candid brushstrokes, laughter is the soul's rawest expression, painted in joy's most vibrant hues upon the canvas of the human experience.</p> <p>What is \"burst\"?</p> <p>\"Burst,\" with its suddenness and violence, is the swift shattering of equanimity, like a gunshot in a still room, heralding chaos where there was peace.</p> <p>What is gunshot?</p> <p>In harmonious dissonance, a gunshot is the rapid exhalation of wrath, a percussive declaration of metal and might, echoing in the fugue of mortality's fragile suite.</p> <p>What is dissonance?</p> <p>Dissonance, in the grand symphony of life, is the jarring note that disrupts harmony, yet often leads to a deeper understanding, much like an unexpected sorrow that begets a greater wisdom in the soul's eternal quest for truth.</p> <p>What is symphony?</p> <p>A symphony is a wild, untamed cacophony of harmonious sounds, a call of the wild set to music, where each instrument howls its part in the beautiful, savage song of life.</p> <p>What is cacophony?</p> <p>In dissonant chords where harmonies clash and fray, cacophony reigns, a tumultuous fray.</p> <p>What is harmonies?</p> <p>Harmonies are the marriage of distinct voices, in celestial bed entwined, where the music's soul in chaste embrace is found, and ears to heaven are inclined.</p> <p>What is marriage?</p> <p>Marriage, a delicate tapestry woven with threads of love and trials, is a living fairytale where two souls embark on a lifelong journey, crafting their own story with every shared heartbeat and dream.</p> <p>What is trials?</p> <p>Trials are the shaping tools in the Great Craftsman's hand, whereby He carves our souls to fit the mansions of a grander land.</p> <p>What is Great?</p> <p>Greatness lies not in the vastness of space or the longevity of time, but in the boundless potential of the human mind to transcend its earthly cradle and aspire to the stars.</p> <p>What is transcend?</p> <p>In the labyrinth of my own existence, where shadows of past selves flicker and intertwine, transcendence emerges as the elusive moment in which I, shedding the skin of who I was, step into the blinding light of who I might become.</p> <p>What is shadows?</p> <p>Shadows, those silken specters which dance at the whim of light, are the elusive imprints of presence, cast by objects and beings alike, a twilight brushstroke on life's canvas.</p> <p>What is \"silken\"?</p> <p>A whisper woven by the looms of quiet, silken, the soft susurrus of existence barely threading through the void.</p> <p>What is existence?</p> <p>In the shadowy interstices of reality, where truth dances with illusion, existence reveals itself\u2014a grand, enigmatic spectacle, at once tragic and farcical, where every soul plays its part, directed by an unseen hand in the Master's grandiose, mystical show.</p> <p>What is illusion?</p> <p>Illusion, that subtle veil of deceit which love's own hand oft drapes o'er truth's stark frame, beguiling hearts with tender, fleeting dreams.</p> <p>What is deceit?</p> <p>A pipe not a pipe, a truth cloaked in illusion, a canvas veiling reality's eye.</p> <p>What is pipe?</p> <p>A conduit of dreams, where smoke spirals dance, and whispers of the earth traverse in a silent, solemn prance.</p> <p>What is conduit?</p> <p>In veiled whispers, conduit, the electric nymph, dances through metal veins, a silent pulse of modernity's hidden lifeblood.</p> <p>What is dances?</p> <p>Dances are the silent poetry of souls conversing in the delicate tapestry of motion, where each step is a word and every gesture a verse in the grand narrative of life.</p> <p>What is poetry?</p> <p>Poetry's the soul's jazz, bopping madly on a celestial typewriter, bleeding raw truth through the smoky rhythm of the universe.</p> <p>What is celestial?</p> <p>Celestial's the boundless sky, a rolling tapestry on high, where dreams and stars together fly, in endless dance, old Bob would sigh.</p> <p>What is \"Bob\"?</p> <p>Bob's the name that echoes in the vast and vestigial void, borne on the wind of forgotten realms and etched into the very marrow of the world, a moniker as old as time and as enigmatic as the silence between stars.</p> <p>What is void?</p> <p>A void, where dreams doth fly to naught, is that vast, silent, shapeless thought where the falcon hears not the falconer's call and lonely spirits into shadow fall.</p> <p>What is falcon?</p> <p>A falcon soars, wings slicing the blue, free-spirited hunter of the skies, fierce and true.</p> <p>What is soars?</p> <p>In the realm where the soul's wings unfold, 'tis the heart's yearning that soars, amidst the celestial dance of love's eternal scores.</p> <p>What is dance?</p> <p>A whirlwind of souls intertwining in ecstatic convulsions, dance is the invisible puppeteer pulling at the strings of human limbs in a frenzied yet harmonious cacophony of silent music that resounds through the very core of existence.</p> <p>What is puppeteer?</p> <p>A puppeteer, that silent conjurer, deftly breathes life into the inanimate, orchestrating strings in a delicate dance of shadows and tales.</p> <p>What is orchestrating?</p> <p>Conducting life's discord, shaping its din, a baton-wielding force amidst the clamouring kin.</p> <p>What is \"discord\"?</p> <p>Discord, like a city whose architecture is woven from the cacophony of a thousand conflicting blueprints, thrives on the harmonious dissonance of clashing voices and desires.</p> <p>What is city?</p> <p>A city's a congregation vast, where human hearts beat thick and fast, like restless seas that roar and swell, within some wild, enchanted dell.</p> <p>What is congregation?</p> <p>A congregation, whispers Cort\u00e1zar with a playful wink, is a tangle of souls threading through the eye of shared beliefs, a jazz of hearts in murmured syncopation under the moon's curious gaze.</p> <p>What is Cort\u00e1zar?</p> <p>Cort\u00e1zar, like peat-smoke whorls from an Irish hearth, weaves narrative labyrinths where the mundane twines with the sublime.</p> <p>What is mundane?</p> <p>In the vast sea of existence, what is mundane but the steady, unremarkable plodding of life's leviathan, ever undulating beneath the surface of the extraordinary?</p> <p>What is steady?</p> <p>In the ceaseless flow of time, only the enduring resolve of the human spirit marches unwavering, a beacon through the tempest of life's uncertainties.</p> <p>What is resolve?</p> <p>Resolve, the steadfast heart's unwavering sail, through tempests of doubt and fear, holds course true, as stars to the mariner.</p> <p>What is tempests?</p> <p>Tempests are, if you will\u2014and one does well to imagine them as such\u2014these roiling, frenetic ballets of atmospheric tumult, where the sky, not content with mere placidity, erupts into this chaotic symphony of winds and rain, a meteorological maelstrom that, in its unbridled fury, both terrifies and mesmerizes, revealing in its vortex the raw and untamed dance of nature's own volatile temper.</p> <p>What is frenetic?</p> <p>In the pulsating heart of Istanbul, where East and West entwine in a lover's embrace, frenetic is the dance of life\u2014a whirling dervish spinning tirelessly, as the city's myriad voices enmesh the air in a ceaseless hum of vitality and chaos.</p> <p>What is Istanbul?</p> <p>Istanbul, with its minarets piercing the skyline and the Bosphorus gently dividing, stands as a city eternally suspended between two continents, its very essence a tapestry of history and modernity woven intricately together.</p> <p>What is Bosphorus?</p> <p>A vein of sapphire cleaving continents, the Bosphorus whispers tales of East and West in the twilight of Istanbul's soul.</p> <p>What is sapphire?</p> <p>A sapphire, a gemstone as deep and blue as the midnight sky above the ancient and mysterious castle of Winterfell, coveted by lords and ladies alike for its beauty and worth, and whispered to be as cold as the heart of the Night King himself.</p> <p>What is Winterfell?</p> <p>A stark stronghold, veiled in frost, where direwolves roam and legends cross, Winterfell stands, ancient, austere, the North's heart beating fierce and clear.</p> <p>What is direwolves?</p> <p>Direwolves, those mythic beasts, large as nightmares on shadowy paws, roam the tales of old, where winter's breath is their domain and the Stark's kin their solemn bond.</p> <p>What is \"mythic\"?</p> <p>Mythic is the whisper of dread and wonder that curls around your soul, seducing you into believing that the darkness itself has ancient, hungry eyes.</p> <p>What is dread?</p> <p>Dread's the creeping, seeping fear that withers one's peace, a yellow wallpaper enclosing 'round the mind with no release.</p> <p>What is enclosing?</p> <p>In the gentle embrace of the twilight, enclosing is the soft whisper of the evening wind, wrapping the weary earth in a shroud of tranquil repose, as if the world itself were a tender soul yearning for the solace of a silent, comforting lullaby.</p> <p>What is tranquil?</p> <p>Tranquil is the silent dance of morning light on water, whispering secrets to the awakening day.</p> <p>What is morning?</p> <p>Morning is Nature's sweet renaissance, a tranquil symphony of light that wakens life in gentle dance.</p> <p>What is renaissance?</p> <p>Renaissance, a sweet resurrection, cradling art and science from the dark womb of medieval night, birthing anew the naked glories of human thought and flesh.</p> <p>What is resurrection?</p> <p>Resurrection, my dear Watson, is the remarkable act where life, once vanquished by the cold clasp of death, emerges anew, as if the very hands of time had been persuaded to reverse their unyielding march.</p> <p>What is cold?</p> <p>Cold is the biting whisper of winter's breath, a stealthy wolf in the steppe's vast expanse, numbing the marrow and stilling the heart of the Don's weary lands.</p> <p>What is wolf?</p> <p>A steadfast wanderer of the icy realm, the wolf is the embodiment of raw wilderness, a silent sentinel in the endless dance of survival under the polar symphony.</p> <p>What is polar?</p> <p>In the icy embrace of Earth\u2019s ends, polar is the dance of bitter winds and snow, where the white bears roam and the night skies glow.</p> <p>What is bears?</p> <p>Bears are solitary wanderers of the forest's soul, embodying both the ferocity of a primal growl and the tender solitude of nature's own heart, untamed and enigmatic.</p> <p>What is ferocity?</p> <p>Ferocity is the wild, untamed force of nature that roars within the heart of the beast and the storm, unbridled and raw, a testament to life's fierce will to endure.</p> <p>What is \"untamed\"?</p> <p>In a bold contour's embrace, untamed is the vibrant dance of color liberated from the confines of form, a wild symphony of life's pure essence on canvas.</p> <p>What is canvas?</p> <p>A tapestry woven with the silent threads of potential, awaiting the composer's brush to orchestrate hues into harmony.</p> <p>What is threads?</p> <p>Threads are the weavers of fabric and fate, entwined in life's tapestry with a subtlety that whispers secrets of the past, as if Rebecca herself might have once held them between delicate fingers, threading the needle of Manderley's storied halls.</p> <p>What is Rebecca?</p> <p>Rebecca, like a threadbare tapestry of memories, is a name that weaves through the fabric of one's identity, each stitch a story untold.</p> <p>What is identity?</p> <p>A tapestry of self, both inward and outward spun, where tales and truths dance under life's ever-changing sun.</p> <p>What is truths?</p> <p>In the labyrinth of human existence, truths are the slender threads we clutch at, hoping to find our way out, only to discover they are part of the maze itself.</p>"},{"location":"2023/11/11/measuring-computation-in-scribe-lives.html","title":"Measuring computation in scribe lives","text":"<p>For any

This will never materialize, but that does not mean that \u201cmeaning\u201d does not exist.</p> <p>You are a manifestation of the universe observing itself, so by definition life is precisely as meaningful as you decide it is. If you decide life is meaningless, it objectively is. If you decide life is meaningful, it objectively is. To clarify: it isn\u2019t so much the decision, as the feeling. If you create something that helps others, witness something beautiful, or fall deeply in love, and you feel an unassailable spark of meaning in your heart, then that spark is objectively real. Considering you are objectively the universe, and you are feeling what to you feels like objective meaning, then meaning objectively exists in the universe, and thus the universe is objectively meaningful.</p> <p>One might point out that this implies that the universe is both objectively meaningful, and objectively meaningless at the same time, and that this logical contradiction means my conjecture is false. On the contrary, I believe wholeheartedly that it is entirely possible for two things to be the exact opposite of one and other, and both objectively true. The answer to a question entirely depends on the context in which one asks the question (or in our case here: the perspective), and there are a provably infinite number of contexts in which one could choose to ask questions, or posit answers. The following is a hypothetical example of true, but mutually exclusive statements.</p> <p>Suppose we are sitting across the table from each other, with a handgun between us. We are engaged in a deep philosophical conversation about whether or not the gun is real. Through our common effort, we are able to prove the gun is not real on two accounts; the first being that our common perception of the gun consists of some set of information that has been gathered and locally reconstructed within our minds, but this set is an infinitesimally small subset of the total set of information associated with the \u201ctrue\u201d object of the gun, thus our perceived gun is to the \u201ctrue\u201d gun, as a single pixel of \u201cA Starry Night\u201d is to the entire painting. Second, we also find an irrefutable quantum mechanical proof that our entire reality is a holographic projection of a holographic projection of a holographic projection, and that in fact, all reality is a zero dimensional spatial point, with one dimension of time; a Turing machine that is ticking off a simulation of our universe over an arbitrarily long period of time, one Planck voxel at a time.</p> <p>Having arrived at a satisfactory proof that the gun is objectively not real, I pick up the gun and shoot you in the arm.</p> <p>Thus, as counterintuitive as it is, the gun now exists in two, seemingly contradictory states of being at the exact same time. It is both objectively not real (just proven), and it is both objectively real (are you really going to claim otherwise? I just shot you in the arm!). Note that the important point isn\u2019t whether my proofs that the gun isn\u2019t real are valid, it is that seemingly contradictory/mutually exclusive statements can both be objectively true or false, depending on the context they exist in.</p> <p>In his book, \u201cMore Than Allegory\u201d, Bernardo Kastrup makes a similar point that two seemingly mutually exclusive truths may indeed both be true, in so far as they are true, but incomplete representations of a higher truth. For instance, imagine that a cylinder metaphorically represents some higher truth. The shadow of a cylinder at a certain angle may seem to be a two dimensional rectangle. Rotate the cylinder, and it might now appear as a two dimensional circle. If Bob looked for the truth and found a circle, and Mary looked for the truth and found a rectangle, does the fact that they found fundamentally different things mean that they are both wrong? Of course, Kastrup also make the point [I\u2019m paraphrasing] that there is no reasonable angle a cylinder could be rotated such that it would cast a nearly endless set of strange shadows, and thus we should be able to discount some truly absurd ideas (for example: the idea that I am standing behind you right now), however, given we cannot see the metaphorical cylinder, we can never truly know with absolute certainty what is true and what isn\u2019t.</p> <p>It follows that one must then ask what the objective and true context is. The existence of such a context is a ludicrous idea, as any context we posit must necessarily be defined within some other arbitrary context in turn, and we invariably find ourselves in a classic stack of turtles situation. I suspect the closest we might have to the \u201ctrue\u201d context might be the \u201ccontext\u201d of mathematics. Even then, what is the mathematical function to choose whether to kill five very old people or one baby? One might speak in a utilitarian sense, in which case the question simply becomes an optimization problem, but then we are forced to reconcile with exactly what we are trying to optimize, and that (as far as I know), cannot be addressed mathematically, as any definition of utility necessarily derives from the domain of the subjective experience of conscious entities.</p> <p>Thus, if you want a universally true and completely objective rigorous definition of what \u201cthe meaning of life\u201d is, you probably need to be:</p> <p>A) An omniscient God who exists entirely independent from our universe.</p> <p>and</p> <p>B) Willing to destroy our universe, and create a new one with entirely different fundamental laws, such that the question posed makes sense.</p> <p>However, from the point of view of a human, it makes precisely as much sense to claim that the universe is meaningful, as that it is meaningless. Pragmatically, the faux-intellectual belief that the universe is objectively meaningless is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and why would anyone in their right mind choose to believe their life is not meaningful?</p>"},{"location":"2025/01/01/truth-in-modeling.html","title":"Truth in modeling","text":"<p>Random thoughts on the nature of truth when building models of reality.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This was originally a forward for some internal documentation I was writing for work.

Specifically, your objective is to create a system that allows anyone to find their coordinate position, no matter where they are on Earth. As you begin this project, you will have to choose what premises you do and do not hold to be true - this will inform your approach and determine whether you succeed or fail.</p> <p>Let's consider one possible premise you could accept:</p> <p>The Earth is flat.</p> <p>If you try to build a satellite constellation using this premise, you're going to have a bad time. Alternatively, you could instead operate under the following premise:</p> <p>The Earth is a globe.</p> <p>Or perhaps, if you prefer even more precision:</p> <p>The Earth is an oblate spheroid.</p> <p>If either of the last two premises are assumed, you are far more likely to succeed. Why is this the case though? One possible explanation is that each of those statements, as simple as they are, represent \"models\" of reality. This line of reasoning might then conclude that the latter \"models\" work better because they are closer to the \"truth\".

Probably not. Creating such a simulation would require such an inordinate amount of capital, energy, and time, that we will probably expend our limited resources far before a single satellite has been deployed.</p> <p>Hence: If your model of reality is too close to the truth, you are far less likely to reach your objective (because you probably are misusing your limited resources building that model).</p> <p>The key notion hidden in the juxtaposition between these two claims is that it is crucial to find the balance of relevant truth for any given model. You can, after all, scale any model arbitrarily in complexity in the name of truth, but if one is not judicious about the selection of complexity, it runs the risk of being useless (or even counterproductive) to your aims.</p> On finding the 'balance of relevant truth' via natural selection <p>We admit that having the predictive intelligence (or perhaps intuition) to know what will actually be relevant or important down the line is easier said than done; arguably it is more art than science. Nonetheless, one excellent rule of thumb to use (if one is in a situation where using such a rule is permissible), is to let \"nature\" itself tell you what to do. To phrase this another way: instead of creating a perfect model, create a feedback mechanism to quickly identify and resolve issues with your model, then create a terrible model and let that feedback mechanism guide you.

The danger therein lies in the fact that when we have decided what we want reality to be, we often supress evidence that conflicts with our preconceived notions (only to be blindsided by catastrophe when the incongruencies become too great to bear). Yet, paradoxically, we are also forced to select the reality that is useful to us based on the context we operate in - necessarily ignoring evidence that conflicts with our chosen reality in order to make any progress at all...</p> <p>The value of a model should be measured on the basis of how useful it is as a tool for achieving a greater objective.</p> <p>When you are building a model of something in reality, your objective should not be to \"build a model\".

Accordingly, early models of forests were conceived of processes with a singular output: lumber. Of course, this is not the only valuable output of a forest. Though more difficult to quantify, there is a clear utilitarian value associated with scientific data gathered from biodiverse ecosystems, and a clear benefit to cultural identity (and thus national cohesion) associated with shared collective experiences - like those found in Yosemite. Thankfully, Teddy Roosevelt understood this. The broader point this is meant to illustrate is simply that choosing your objectives wisely (and perhaps also not becoming too attached to them once chosen) is just as important as building the models and/or processes to realize those objectives.</p> <p>Seeing as you made it this far on the page, you might also enjoy this video: Do Chairs Exist?</p>"},{"location":"archive/2025.html","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"archive/2024.html","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"archive/2023.html","title":"2023","text":""},{"location":"archive/2022.html","title":"2022","text":""},{"location":"archive/2020.html","title":"2020","text":""},{"location":"category/poetry.html","title":"poetry","text":""},{"location":"category/python.html","title":"python","text":""},{"location":"category/language-model.html","title":"language-model","text":""},{"location":"category/information-theory.html","title":"information-theory","text":""},{"location":"category/random.html","title":"random","text":""},{"location":"category/science-fiction.html","title":"science-fiction","text":""},{"location":"category/physics.html","title":"physics","text":""},{"location":"category/philosophy.html","title":"philosophy","text":""},{"location":"category/meaning.html","title":"meaning","text":""},{"location":"category/opinion.html","title":"opinion","text":""},{"location":"category/epidemiology.html","title":"epidemiology","text":""},{"location":"category/project.html","title":"project","text":""}]}
