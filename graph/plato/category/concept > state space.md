## tldr
Before summarizing "state space", consider how you might answer if someone asked you what the "state" of the weather was outside.

Putting aside the strange nomenclature, you might answer: "sunny", "rainy", or perhaps "overcast".

If we say that each one of these weather conditions is a potential *instance* of a *state* of weather, then the set (ie: "space") of possible weather *states* is the *state space*.

Phrased differently, we might say that in some arbitrary environment $E$ (which could be the weather, a chess game, or your life), there is some set of possible discrete (and distinct) configurations of $E$. The set of unique configurations is the state space.

> [!question]- Environment Definition
> In this context the term environment refers to *anything* that is made up of *other things* and can change throughout time. I think - though I'm not sure 100% confident this is the exact right definition.

# task
- [ ] convert environment definition to atomic
- [ ] read the reference wikipedia pages, check understanding is correct
- [ ] [[{axon.query} are state spaces necessarily made up of discrete states]]
