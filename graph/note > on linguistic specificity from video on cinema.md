# Excerpt

> Modernism is the thing they don't make them like anymore. In this video, I'm going to argue that the shift in how movies field can be described as a shift first from modernism and post-modernism, and then from postmodernism into the meta-modernism we see now. To really understand that shift and what meta-modernism looks like in film, we first need to broadly understand both modernism and post-modernism in film. Because meta-modernism is reacting to both of them and incorporating both of them into itself. All three of the ''big-isms'' we're talking about here are hard to pin down. Philosophers, all critics and media critics all disagree on what exactly they are and how to best describe them. 


# Notes
- I'm agnostic to the subject and assertions made in the video, but I found it interesting that the author kinda says:
	1. "Here are three entities"
	2. "Here is a discrete statement about the three entities and their relations that would require a rigorous definition of each for me to make"
	3. "Also, they aren't actually defined"
- This isn't a critique of the video (the author gives his subjective definition later) - it's an observation of how humanity uses language
- Specifically, it feels as though searching for provably rigorous meaning in language, (in the context of natural language processing at least), is possibly fruitless
	- The reasoning being that the meaning isn't actually there to start with - language isn't a mechanism by which we assign symbolic labels to pre-existing meaning - it is itself a dynamic process that invents and refines itself along the way.
- How to put this? - A process that refines and selects itself. This is poorly articulated; at the risk of articulating this even worse - the way I'm intuitively thinking about this, is as a sort of high dimensional latent space of meaning, with words being metaphorical n-D "bubbles" floating through the space.
- Imprecise words are wide bubbles - they encompass many possible interpretations, covering a larger portion of the space.
- Over time, these bubbles shrink, becoming more precise
	- The process that causes them to shrink is the act of language interacting with language across the minds of humans (?)
	- EG: The video essay linked above - the author puts out a video essay on these terms, interprets them, other people watch it, the interpretation spreads - if its a good interpretation it spreads faster and is adopted, and is shaped by natural selection across minds - the selection factor in whether it is a good interpretation is (probably, grain of salt) related to the functionality and definition of a term, which we can conceive of as being a "smaller" metaphorical bubble - albeit perhaps a "deeper" and more interconnected one - lending it more utility for a precise description of reality
		- Not totally confident in this assertion, but the think goes:
			- imagine what it was like for cavemen when there was only "close" and "far" in respect to spatial distance.
			- If I shout: "Tiger, close!" that does give you information, but if I can instead choose between: very close, close, medium distance, somewhat far, quite far, extremely distant, etc - we have added new "bubbles" (terms) to the latent space, and shrunk the size of the existing ones
			- thus: creating gradations of meaning where before there was just an imprecise cloud - and hence: adaptivity
- also ofc, with this metaphor we might say that the bubbles also slowly move through the space over time
- also, this is a bad metaphor because in our latent space of dynamic word bubbles, adding and refining bubbles grows the potential space, so I guess they're kinda nD meaning bubble stepping stones to a broader latent space, that is itself manifested into existence by the process of bubble synthesis/language evolution?
