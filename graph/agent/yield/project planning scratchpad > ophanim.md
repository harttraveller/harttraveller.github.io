%%
- create a piece of software that *really* acts as a true second brain.
	- Allows you to set objectives and provides a framework that streamlines the execution of tasks to reach those objectives
	- Allows you to build an intuitive reality model that deepens understanding of reality and helps you predict the future, to inform the selection of objectives
	- Allows you to process data feeds and information from more sources than you could ever actually handle as an individual human, and filter out the signal from the noise.
	- Enhances your ability to think by providing intuitive formal logic, and evaluation systems both for the logic, and for generalized information about the world, linguistic or otherwise.
- Such a piece of software would probably need to have an entirely different underlying data structure than obsidian.
	- Resolution of polysemy - note names, meaning derived from connections between entities and not the entities themselves.
	- Complex chains of relationships - perhaps uses a basic graph for some tasks as with obsidian, but would need many other data structures, like
		- basic ability to add edge types
			- I mean c'mon, neither obsidian, nor logseq, nor any other similar software supports this well
				- probably has to do with the difficulty in retaining markdown while implementing a data structure that supports this
				- or the lack of general demand, as the current features probably are sufficient for the majority of the market...
		- directed acyclic graphs for causal modeling
		- hypergraph data structure for linguistic processing, and more complex chained relationships
		- as mentioned earlier, formal logic integration
- formal logic on graph
- causal hypergraphs
- linguistic hypergraphs
- global event tracking, information tracking, system for finding truth and parsing signal from noise
- rigorous, collective, decentralized graph, which many people contribute to
- ideally people could democratically set objectives, create feedback signals, carry out actions themselves, or direct the system to carry out actions
- the long term objective would be to create a self sustaining cybernetic serentity made of people and information systems, which can converge towards truth, maximizes signal, minimizes noise, and can carry out tasks in the real world based on the objectives it sets
- automatically breaks long text into atomics and attempts to identify similar atomics
