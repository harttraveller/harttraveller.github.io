# Description
- For information on what this page is see -> [[AGENT framework]]
- For reasoning for this axiom see -> [[The meaning of life is to make life meaningful]]

# Edge
- [[query > what is meaning (qualia)?]]
- [[query > should one focus on making life meaningful for others, or for oneself?]]
- [[query > how does one actually make life meaningful?]]
- potential issue: [[query > if one of the protocol axioms is "make life meaningful", and the PA are an implicit definition of the meaning of life, isn't this circular logic?]]
