# text
Before summarizing "state space", consider how you might answer if someone asked you what the "state" of the weather was outside.

Putting aside the strange nomenclature, you might answer: "sunny", "rainy", or perhaps "overcast".

If we say that each one of these weather conditions is a potential *instance* of a *state* of weather, then the set (ie: "space") of possible weather *states* is the *state space*.
