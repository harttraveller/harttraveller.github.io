Hierarchy is defined as:

> A hierarchy is a system or structure within which entities are organized according to their level of power, with higher-ranking positions having more control over lower-ranking ones.

Traditionally, we think of hierarchies in terms of social and political systems. However, there is an alternative hierarchical structure: the temporal hierarchy.

Given the disproportionate power everyone in the present has over everyone who might yet live in the future, *anyone* alive in the present has disproportionately more power over *the future* than they anyone else in the present - thus they find themselves at the apex of this temporal hierarchy.

Put another way: if we were to create a "hierarchy of hierarchies" constructed on the basis of the latent power one has, the temporal hierarchy would likely find itself at the top of that hierarchy.
