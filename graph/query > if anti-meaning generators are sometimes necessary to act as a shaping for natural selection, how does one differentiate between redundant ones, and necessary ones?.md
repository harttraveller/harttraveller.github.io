# reminder note
- intuition
	- probably need to factor in the "anti-meaning level" - how much AM is generated
	- if we could quantify how "useful" a particular AM generator is for shaping natural selection, then whether or not it's worth keeping around would probably be a function of:
		- the quantity of AM generated
		- the usefulness of the AM generator for natural selection
- tangent
	- could potentially eliminate AM generators and switch to a paradigm of intelligent design as opposed to natural selection
		- ext -> might need to, to avoid human extinction - ref: historical entropy consumption of more evolved organisms
		- cav -> probably extremely difficult given the complexity of the natural world
			- perhaps better to simply try and avoid really bad outcomes?
