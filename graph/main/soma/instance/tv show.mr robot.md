# minor criticisms
- becomes difficult to suspend disbelief as seasons progress
- found the political commentary was intellectually lacking, kinda felt like it boiled down to
	- dynamic consisting of two parts:
		- powerful people = bad
		- rebels who reject "the system" = good
	- but this is an overused archetypal trope
- as time progresses it casts this dynamic into doubt
	- however, it felt to me like it simply casts the dynamic into doubt for the purpose of defying expectations, without offering an alternative rationale for why this narrative archetype might be false/incomplete/overly simplistic
- that said, this interpretation may be entirely wrong, and I would still recommend
