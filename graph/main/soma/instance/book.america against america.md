> Any abstract reasoning can only be derived from observation and analysis of facts, and for abstract reasoning to be convincing, it is important that there are ~~no~~ convincing facts to lay the foundation.

- comment -> I think "no" was a typo. IMO this depends on the definition of "fact" and how one derives facts. A "fact" could be a logically/mathematically proven statement, an account of a historical event, or the factual reality of subjectively experienced qualia within individuals. It seems like absent context defining the criteria for what might be considered a "fact", this statement could be interpreted in a myriad of ways.

> Sometimes one needs to do a kind of work, which is to provide the opportunity to think, rather than the conclusion of thinking.

> This book takes the United States as the object of analysis, because the United States, like China, constitutes a special phenomenon of humanity in the twentieth century, which can be called the "American phenomenon". The "Chinese phenomenon" is why this ancient civilization with a long history of more than 2,000 years has declined in the modern era. Why is it lagging behind the modern nations of the world? This has caused generations of scholars and scholars to think hard. The "American phenomenon" has a different dimension, and people wonder why this nation, with a short history of only two hundred years, has become the world's leading developed country today. I believe that scholars living in the twentieth century have a responsibility to study these two phenomena. As a Chinese scholar, he has a dual responsibility to study both the "Chinese phenomenon" and the "American phenomenon. In this way, he can better understand himself and the world, and better explore the path to China's strength.

- summary -> Establishes intent of book, summarized as:
	- claim -> American civilization is prosperous.
	- claim -> Chinese civilization is lagging behind America, even though it is far older.
		- note -> This book was published in 1991 when US GDP was ~20x higher than CN.
	- objective -> Study American civilization to identify factors contributing to US success so they can be replicated, or adapted, for China.

- summary -> Key point from book: Huning interprets that America cannot be easily defined by any single property or group, given that any time one creates such a definition, one invariably finds counterexamples to that definition. This was the motivation behind the title of the book, at least as is established in the first dozen pages or so.

> Economic decision-making in the United States is largely controlled by private consortia.

- comment -> There are perspectives from which this is true, but I think those perspectives are rather simplistic. IMO, The decisions themselves rarely happen in individuals or small groups of individuals. Given WN's earlier elucidation of the 'network' point, it would seem appropriate to apply that here and rephrase this point as follows:
	- rephrased -> Economic decision making is an emergent process with its causal roots in systemic information flows and feedback loops across society. The nexus points where these decisions manifest are the interwoven private/public consortia.
