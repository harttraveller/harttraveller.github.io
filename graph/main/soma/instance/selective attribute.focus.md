# note
- #todo -> refactor "selective attribute" - far too broad and needs deeper thought
	- when an entity is a 'focus entity' in the context of a set of entities, at the exclusion of other entities in the set, what is this a instance of?
	- it seems it would be an agent percept, but in a linguistic context, and specifically the one this term is used in in this graph, focus refers to the the primary subject of a some information based entity, like a video
		- #todo -> perhaps refactor `focus` to `subject`?
			- eg: `film.lincoln` -> `has.subject` -> `person.Abraham Lincoln`
