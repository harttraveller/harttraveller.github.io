# note
- Ironically, the entity: `instance` is a `category` - attributing to the fact that it is defined by a set of criteria for entities in reality, and is not an instantiated entity itself.
	- In a sense, `instance` could be an instance of `concept`, or `word`, or `entity`
	- however, the functional purpose of the architecture of this graph is not to perfectly capture and disambiguate all possible meanings
	- rather, it intends to serve a functional purpose
		- information retrieval
	- and an aesthetic purpose
		- pretty graph
	- accordingly, stuff in the instance directory is the lowest functional example of an instance, and stuff in the category directory can be categories, which are necessarily also instances, but just not "base" instances in a functional sense
		- #todo -> add this information to graph architecture docs
- eventually, there may be some philosophical, and utilitarian value to delineating the underlying discrete primitive concepts that any given term in any given context is pointing to
	- trying to do this right now would be serious scope creep though
