# reminder note
- given premise of utilitarianism, making life meaningful for others takes precedence
	- ceteris paribus, there is no reason why any one individual is more important than any other, let alone multiple other people
- the caveat being that one may *have* to make life meaningful for oneself, in order to have the motivation and will to actually go out and improve the world
	- thus, the extent to which one should focus on oneself is equal to the extent to which one can optimize ones effectiveness in helping others by helping oneself
		- notably, there is incomplete information here - any answer that attempts to optimize this will necessarily just be an estimate
