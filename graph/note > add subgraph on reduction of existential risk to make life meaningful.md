# notes

items are under #todo

- integrate AUC of meaning curve over the duration of the existence of the universe
	- want to maximize this area
		- thus, whether one things reducing existential risk is good depends on whether one thinks progress is possible, expected, and to what extent
			- is progress towards a better world possible?
				- #todo -> convert to query, but intuitively yes
- follow up question
	- what can we do to mitigate existential risk, and what are the major existential risks?
	- should suffering risks be included?
