## note
- start from premise that everything is as meaningful as we perceive it to be
- thus, meaning vacuums are entities in reality which consume meaning, and replace it with meaninglessness
	- meaning, and meaninglessness, are both *experiences*
	- meaninglessness is not the absence of meaning, it is a distinct experience
