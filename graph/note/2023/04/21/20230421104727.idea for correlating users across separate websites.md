%%
# archive
- archived and not implemented due on the basis of
	- ethical considerations
	- potential political fallout
	- security risks in holding PII data

# idea
- once two accounts are likely to belong to same identity
	- correlated via demographic characteristics, patterns in language, time activity, etc
- send ip tracking link to both accounts
	- if target IP is the same, cross reference against db of known VPN providers
	- if unique IP, probably the same underlying identity
		- would need to update bayesian probability graph, not necessarily the same identities still
- idea would be to build a system that does this in an automated fashion, while still maintaining a level of selectivity that avoids arousing suspicion
