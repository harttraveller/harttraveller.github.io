# note
- some pages (eg: this one) have "hidden" information
- the purpose of this is to create a superficial access threshold for some information
- the utility of this threshold is that people who randomly visit the site are less likely to click to a weird page, and get an unpleasant first impression impression
- I figure anyone who goes to the repository will probably look through enough of the graph that this risk is mitigated, and the broader context becomes available
- the information on this page is hidden purely as an implied clue
- I'm certainly not important enough to warrant this kind of security, but games make life fun!
