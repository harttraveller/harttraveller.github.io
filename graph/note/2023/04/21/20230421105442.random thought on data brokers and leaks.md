# thought
- given the modern state of PII collection by data brokers
- its moderately surprising someone hasn't simply leaked a database containing the private information of most people in america, though this could apply to any highly-internet-saturated country

%%
- I mean seriously, if you look at the data collected by any small time data broker
	- eg, [this random](https://agedleadstore.com/privacy-notice-for-california-residents/) data broker
- the amount of private information, ranging from easy stuff like peoples names, SSN, all the way to their DNA, obviously what they buy, and to some extent stuff private as the porn they watch, and the unconscious psychological desires that they might not even be consciously aware of, which motivate their decisions
	- case in point: try to escape from the device fingerprinting service made by [fingerprint](https://fingerprint.com/)
		- if you use firefox, turn on experimental fingerprinting protection, and clear your cookies, *and* web browsing history, *and* use a new IP address for every single session, that does the trick - sometimes...
- it's kinda crazy that some rogue actor hasn't just leaked a massive graph database
	- it would be super interesting if we moved into a post-privacy world very abruptly and everyone had to collectively reconcile with the fact that the people they pretend to be aren't actually who they really are
		- I wonder how people would react... I imagine there would be an initial reactionary egoistic defensiveness, followed shortly by a collectiveness sheepishness
			- but that is conjecture, and this is a hypothesis I don't want to test
				- or at least I don't want to be the one responsible for testing it, that person will probably be crucified by the mob!
- also, it feels kinda like one can delineate between two groups of people in society
- groups
	- 1. those that know this is the state of modern data collection and inference
	- 2. those that don't know
- it's interesting how in so far as I can tell, group 2 is in the dark, and would see it as some kind of moral outrage if they knew what was happening
	- eg: cambridge analytica scandal
		- they were amateurs, and its impressive how facebook managed to deflect criticism of CA using FB platform the way it was designed to be used onto CA for literally just using their platform when literally any major technology company is orders of magnitude more invasive
			- I suppose it was mostly political, kinda like a warning shot to other companies that would otherwise be fine with selling data/services to geopolitical adversaries
- but also, group 1 is perfectly aware how group 2 would react, and we just sort of collectively have agreed to let group 1 continue to exist in the dark
- the real question is, does group 1 actually want to know?
- I would guess that they think they want to know, but they don't really want to know.
- It's sort of a "can't have your cake and eat it too" situation, except having your cake in this context is having your privacy, and eating it is being able to still derive egoistic satisfaction from posting the exact details of your life; where you work, vacation, who you sleep with, your social status, income, etc - all over instagram/facebook/etc etc etc...
	- the irony of the aforementioned statement in the context of this digital mind is palpable
