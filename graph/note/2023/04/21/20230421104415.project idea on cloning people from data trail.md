# system description
- run graph db service to correlate disparate information pertaining to individual identity across separate websites
	- could potentially implement [[20230421104727.idea for correlating users across separate websites|idea for correlating users across separate websites]]
- collect data generated from individual and use to train/tune LLM and instantiate a copy of them in the cloud
	- wouldn't have access to all their memories and such, but given the global similarity of people in respect to their base wants, desires, strategies, etc -
		- could be useful for inferring generic latent information about them
			- specifically by asking model questions, then asking the person questions via shell accounts, then checking responses, and performing parametric tests so as to help the model converge towards a realistic representation of the individual in question
- in respect to the utility of such a project
	- also could be used for behavioral prediction
- also doesn't just have to be LLM, probably a number of other system architectures that could be applied
	- agent based model, RL, manually programmed human psychological model, simple statistical model.
		- could probably throw a markov chain to represent stimulus-response behavioral schemas in there somewhere
