# note
- suppose we have a movie like "inception"
- the entity `inception` is an `instance` of the entity `movie`
- however, what is the entity `movie` an instance of?
	- while initially, it seems like the answer might be `audiovisual information medium` or some variant, this is doesn't seem quite right
- the entity `movie` might be any of the following:
	- word
	- concept
	- audiovisual information medium (AIM) *class*
- however, intuitively it seems more accurate to say that instead of `movie` being an AIM, that `movie` is a class, for which there is a set of criteria defining its members, and that the term itself refers to the criteria
- or in other words, if we were to take all the discrete entities in reality, and one applied some set of criteria $C_M$ defining movies
	- which is to say that any entity which met the criteria would be a `movie`
- that we would find that what `movie` actually is - what the class actually is - *is* the set of criteria
	- when refer to `movie` we are often implicitly referring to an arbitrary member of the class, but the class itself is probably best defined as a collection of criteria.
