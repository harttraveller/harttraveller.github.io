alias:
- what does ">" represent in the ontology?

#future/backlog 

# Note
- At the moment, I suppose it is implied, which is sub-optimal.
- Most likely it is "of", eg: [is.instance > (of) book]
	- however, for something like [has.author] it is not implying of, rather it would be implying a sort of non-linguistic connection, which if rephrased might be:
		- "the author is X"

# Task
- [ ] Map out implied linguistic standings for '>' char
