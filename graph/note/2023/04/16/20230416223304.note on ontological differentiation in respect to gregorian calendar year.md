- note on ontological differentiation in respect to gregorian calendar year

#future/backlog 

# Note
- It's necessary to differentiate between the concept that is the gregorian calendar year, which is a concept and not a one-dimensional temporal region, and instantiated examples of gregorian calendar years, which are one-dimensional temporal regions.
- This could be achieved by adding information to the node such as:
	- [is.instance > date system]
		- or more accurately, its a subcomponent of a date system - the gregorian calendar
	- [instantiated.is > one-dimensional temporal region]
- But adding [instantiated.is] as an edge type feels iffy, for some reason.
- For now, its probably just best to be as literal as possible, and add the abstract ontological connection to the year.

# Tasks
- [ ] revisit once graph is filled out and restructure abstract ontological core accordingly
