# Note
- Specifically, what is the relationship between the entity: "gregorian calendar year"  (GCY) and the entity: "gregorian calendar" (GC) ?
- Perhaps it is a subcomponent of the entity? It's not really a subcomponent though. An engine might be a subcomponent of a car.
- We might say that a GCY is a defining feature of GC, but again this doesn't really work. The color green is a defining feature of grass, and the analogue for the gregorian calendar might be the mathematical equations used to compute the year.
- It would be more appropriate to say that the entity GC 'generates' the entity 'GCY', as by nature of the existence of GC, and the structural rules defining it, GCY comes into existence. I think this is what I will go with for now until a better alternative emerges.
