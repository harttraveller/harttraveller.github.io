# note
- a 'class' refers to the set of entities, and the criteria that define that set
- an 'instance' refers to a specific entity within the set
- another group that would be useful is a referent for an arbitrary but unspecified entity within the set
- for example, consider the term 'artificial intelligence'
	- artificial intelligence is a class, with a set of criteria defining it
		- when entities meet those criteria, they are considered *a* artificial intelligence
