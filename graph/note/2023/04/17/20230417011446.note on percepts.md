# note
- reality is built from axiomatic somatosensory data, or percepts
- these exist on a hypergraph - networks of networks building up to much more complex concepts
- high level ontologies like BFO are highly abstracted away from low level percepts
	- perceived reality fits in the middle
- ideally we should find an ontological structure to unify the low level percepts everything is based on and the high level abstract categories of things in reality

# task
#todo 
- [ ] revisit point
	- [ ] refactor and provide context/explanation
	- [ ] integrate in graph as atomic
