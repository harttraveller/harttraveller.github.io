Thanks for visiting. The primary objective of this project is to create an analytically rigorous definition of [[What is the meaning of life?|the meaning of life]] and a systematic framework that defines how one goes about effectively realizing that meaning. The secondary objective is to track my own progress towards realizing that meaning.

## Purpose

I'm publishing this on the off chance it is interesting to others, and hopefully as a way to get critical feedback. Perhaps it would be useful as a template? Though this is a somewhat hubristic notion.

At any rate, given we have limited time on Earth - this also serves as control mechanism to try and ensure time is spent on items that connect back to the most important stuff; if there isn't a path to a particular objective from within this graph, then it's probably not worthwhile.

## Shortcuts

You can return to this page with the `:` key. The `[` and `]` keys toggle the local and global graph respectively. The `/` key jumps to search bar.

## Architecture

I'll add more details on the project [[Architecture|architecture]] once graph is filled out a little more. In general, dead links are a work in progress.
