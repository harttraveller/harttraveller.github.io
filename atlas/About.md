## Header Art
Header art is generated with [midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com) and [upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl). I'm using [this](https://reddit.com/r/RokosPhoenixArt) subreddit as a free image hosting solution.

## Site Hosting
The site is hosted by [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) publish. If you'd like to use this theme or the added javascript features [[Obsidian publish theme and features|this]] page has more information.

# Atomics
The site uses an atomic framework; creating pointers to unique ideas instead of rearticulating them should reduce information redundancy.
