## Overview

This page indexes predictions about the future. Unrealized predictions are not yet right, nor are they wrong. Realized predictions are either right, wrong, or "other". The latter refers to when the parameters of the initial prediction did not account for the events or variables that were manifested. These are still wrong, but they're wrong in a different way.
