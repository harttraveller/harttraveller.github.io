## Welcome

Thanks for visiting. When I get around to uploading some structured stuff, I'll link those pages on the [[Index|index]].

The primary objective of this project is to create an analytically rigorous definition for [[What is the meaning of life?|the meaning of life]] and an accompanying system for realizing that meaning, while simultaneously consolidating this within a tracking framework. On the meaning point - note it isn't an objective interpretation - in fact by definition it must be incorrect for it to be true. I'll add more details on the [[Overview|project]] structure once I've gotten around to uploading the backlog of work.

> [!print]- Purpose
> Publishing this stuff optimally creates a medium for to receive critical feedback, plus it acts as an implied social incentive to get my thoughts together. Finally, it also serves as control mechanism to try and ensure that time is utilized wisely. As the shortest path between a task node and an abstract objective node increases in length, the probability the task is important decreases proportionately - or at least that's the intuitive heuristic.
