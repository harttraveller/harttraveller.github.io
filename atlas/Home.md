Thanks for visiting. This site is a collection of stream of consciousness notes. I imagine ideas will crystalize and structure will organically emerge over the months and years. I'm publishing them on the off chance they're interesting to others, and hopefully as a way to get critical feedback.

## Purpose

The purpose is to document my thought process in trying to figure out a systematic framework for the meaning of life, and how one goes about effectively realizing that meaning. I expect the notes will be a mix of stuff that is generally applicable, and stuff that is personally specific.

## Shortcuts

You can return to this page with the `:` key. The `[` and `]` keys toggle the local and global graph respectively. The `/` key jumps to search bar.

## Question

[[What is the meaning of life?]]
