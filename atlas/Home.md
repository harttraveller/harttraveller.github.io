# Welcome

Thanks for visiting. This site is a filtered subset of my [second brain](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/). Feel free to reach out via the [contact](https://www.harttraveller.com) form on my professional site.

## Description

For the sake of thought experiment, suppose that humans are crucibles for the recombination of information. That is to say: we ingest cultural, technological, sensory, etc. data, permute it, and then release it back out into the broader organism of "humanity".

If this were the case, then I suppose what this site intends to do is to capture that process for this particular entity (me).

> I've delayed uploading stuff for some time due to information security considerations. I expect most of what I write/create will be wrong, useless, or unintentionally redundant. Ideally, there will be *something* that is original or interesting, but it's hard for me to tell what that will be beforehand; hence - uploading (almost) everything.

> Unfortunately one cannot have ones cake and eat it too; it's somewhat difficult to share ones thoughts honestly while also avoiding revealing information about oneself. I figure that given that A) I will be dead relatively soon, B) I'm not particularly important, and C) life as a whole is accelerating, and the window for me to contribute something may be closing - the possible utility of anything I might contribute crosses the threshold of personal cost in respect to information transparency.

There are three main directories besides the `atlas` directory (which contains information about the site itself): `brain` `input` and `think` - or BIT.

The `brain` dir contains ontological structure information that can be used for traversing the graph. The `input` dir contains logs of input information. The `think` directory contains output information, or in less abstract terms: stuff I write or create.

Note those pages may range from near complete articles, to stream of consciousness notes, to empty pages created as a reminder to fill in the page later.

## Navigation

The site is organized on a graph. You can hit the `:` key on your keyboard to toggle the local graph - to see the pages connected to the one you are currently on. This can also be used to reveal hidden connections.
%%[[TS -  KIC 8462852 - extraterrestial signal data]]%%

The `'` key - right of the the local graph key - can be used to toggle the global graph. Finally, the `/` key toggles the quick search and file browser.
