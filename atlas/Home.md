# Welcome
Thanks for visiting. This is a collection of [[#Pages|atomics and published]] written work. I intend to add an index of [[label|labels]] when there is a more substantial amount of content. %%Feel free to reach out via my [portfolio](https://www.harttraveller.com/contact) site.%%

# Resources
Header art is generated with [midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com) and [upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl). The site is hosted by [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) publish.

# Shortcuts
The `/` key toggles the quick search and file browser. The `:` and `'` keys toggle the local and global graph respectively.

# Status
Ideally only pages with a moderate level of structure will be uploaded, however, many of them will also continuously evolve. The #active tag is used to denote developing items, and the #static tag is used to denote items not currently under development.

# Pages
The #post tag indexes formal full length pages. The #atom tag indexes discrete units of information. An example of the latter is included below. Clicking the icon on the top right will flip to the atomic page.

> [!info]- Atomic Details
> Atomics are an experiment to see if one can organize ideas by breaking them down into component pieces and embedding them within pages. The initial cost is high, but I imagine being able to create pointers to ideas instead of rearticulating them will have O(log(n)) time complexity as opposed to O(n) in respect to creative output. Ideally this also reduces information redundancy. They can also be embedded within each other.
