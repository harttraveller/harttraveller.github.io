To start, what is an agent?




Whenever you do a "thing", it must connect back to a particular concrete objective, or at least an abstract objective

The ideal is that one creates a set of absolute objectives, which one creates a rigorous philosophical structure around.

For example: "make life meaningful"

These can then be converted into abstract objectives.

For example: "create meaning generators"

Which in turn can be converted into concrete objectives.

For example: "create an app which helps people find new friends, and build long lasting deep relationships"

Which is qualified by discrete success criteria, which are measured by feedback signals.

For example if you had the feedback signals:
- $N$ = number of users on app
- $F$ = average number of friendships created through app per user
- $Y$ = average number of years friendship found through app lasts for
- $M$ = average mood of users
- $S$ = average shift in mood that is directly causally connected to app usage

You could create compound feedback signals from this, eg:
- $N \times F \times Y$ = approx. total additional "years of friendship" added to universe

But that is a subjective determination.

Ideally one can set realizable success criteria connected to the feedback signals. Success criteria should have a quantitative threshold, and specific realization date. For example:

- $S_1$ = $N > 10,000$ *by* 2024-01-01
- $S_2$ = $F > 3$ by 2024-01-01

Intuitively, the creation of feedback signals with a high STNR and rigorous definitions will probably be objectives themselves, sometimes.
