# Welcome

Thanks for visiting. This site serves as a blog, and as an interface for a project I'm working on. 

In respect to the former, structured [[#Posts|posts]] are listed at the bottom of the page. More info on the latter can be found in the project callout below.

> [!warning]- Disclaimers
> 
> There are two noteworthy disclaimers. A TLDR is provided for each below. More information on each is included in the secondary callout. For context, an incomplete but concise one sentence description of the project is:
> 
> ![[! incomplete concise rokosphoenix project description#atom]]
> 
> **1. TLDR: Claim evaluation**
> - There may be some strange claims on the site.
> - They are considered for the purpose of evaluation, and in many cases - refutation.
> 
> **2. TLDR: Copyrighted external media**
> - Source pages may seem to include internal links that lead to copyrighted media authored by other people or entities.
> - **These links are dead links.**
> - The files aren't uploaded and are only on my local system.
> - They appear because while this project is open source, it is also an [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault that I use as a personal library and information retrieval tool.

>> [!info]- More Information
>>
>> **1. Claims and chains of reasoning**
>>- In the evaluation of claims, an attempt is made to consider every possible answer (subject to time constraints).
>> - Because one page is (ideally) dedicated to each (ideally) discrete claim, and because it is possible that contentious claims may be evaluated, you might find pages with strong assertions about a disputed subjects.
>> - (Ideally) for all claims (but especially for unsettling ones), I'll attempt to include the source (as it might not be me), and the relevant counterclaim(s).
>> 	- Though sometimes I may forget to do this, or might just not have gotten around to assessing the claim.
>>
>> **2. Dead links to copyrighted material**
>> - Note that "internal link" refers to links that lead to pages or documents on the site (or in the obsidian vault), "outgoing link" refers to links that lead to pages or documents on other websites.
>> - Per disclaimer (1), I attempt to include links to sources wherever possible.
>> 	- Generally, a link to a source will be an internal link that leads to a page on this site, which then has outgoing links to other places on the web pertaining to that source.
>>- As this project is open source, I will try to include outgoing links to reference information (eg: wikipedia, goodreads) or direct links to the document if it is legally hosted on the web.
>> - In cases where a source is a PDF or document in general, there may be an internal link to that document on the page.
>> 	- These lead to files on my local system.
>> 	- The reason the links are still included is attributable to the use of the project as a personal library/information retrieval tool.
>> - I don't intend to violate any copyright laws, so internal links to documents should always be dead links (from your perspective).
>> 	- This is true regardless of copyright actually - a hedge on my part.
>> 	- In the unlikely scenario where this is not the case, please don't hesitate to reach out to me so I can fix it!
>> 	- The sole exception should be documents or media I author.

> While ideally the posts are accessible, and can stand on their own, the same cannot be said for the underlying project, which is somewhat niche, moderately convoluted, and probably uninteresting to most people.
> 
> For these reasons, this site obfuscates access a little, but bypassing this is easy if you know where to look. The [[Introduction|introduction]] page is a good place to start.
