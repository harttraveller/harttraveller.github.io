# Preface

On the [[About|about]] page, the description provided for the project was:

![[! incomplete concise rokosphoenix project description#atom]]

While not technically false, it is also wholly insufficient. This page seeks to expand on the definition, with the caveat that the information here is still incomplete and subject to change.

> [!question]- Why so long?
> I intend to refine the project docs to make it easier and faster to gain a comprehensive understanding, time permitting.
> 
> I would prefer to convey everything in just few words, and I'm certainly aware that writing dozens of pages, and implying "you need to read this to understand what I'm doing" doesn't appeal to anyone (unless they are already obsessed with the subject material).
> 
> Alas, this is easier said than done... One can take solace in the fact that it certainly isn't a new dilemma!
> 
> ![[quote > mark twain shorter letter#text]]

> Of course, trying to ensure that *anyone* can understand introduces redundancy, and only slows down the people who already understand *most* of the thing and are interested in it, and perhaps they are the true "target market"?
> 
> Speaking of redundancy, the excess context required for the project is the primary reason for compartmentalization between it and the posts. The split between the two will probably be roughly 20:1, but I'd bet if there is any engagement, it will be perfectly inverted!

# Overview

While not technically false, the following points expand on the aforementioned description.

1. Research project to extend and merge [BFO](https://basic-formal-ontology.org/), [CCO](https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies), and other ontologies.
2. Graph based system for evaluating claims with the goal of "finding truth'.
3. Hierarchical philosophy rigorously defining a (possible) meaning of life.
4. Structure for event modeling and future forecasting.
5. Abstract agent oriented framework for reaching objectives.

> [!note] Association Between Points
> Specifically, the intention is to ensure the objectives provided as "targets" to the agent oriented framework (5) are based on the reality model formed by (1) and (2), connect to the protocol established by (3), and account for contingencies and probabilities of future events (or non-events) elucidated by (4).

A number of tools are used in pursuit of these objectives, but the primary one is [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - a [graph](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Graph_theory) based [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) editor.

> [!tangent]- Obsidian Recommendation
> I'd highly recommend this software. A good metaphor to describe it would be: "The VSCode for text that isn't code". It's highly customizable as well, which could be construed as a benefit (as it's really fun to do this), or a drawback insofar as you may spend more time streamlining your workflow than actually getting work done.
> 
> There's a lot more to cover here on obsidian, so I'll leave it here and link an article I'm writing for a family friend here once it is complete.
> 
> 
> If you prefer to stick with VSCode, [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) and [dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so/) are popular alternatives. There are definitely benefits to these, as VSCode has the most and best extensions - the caveat being that it is a *code* editor, and so while it works fine for markdown (and is better for some specific purposes, like mkdocs sites), it doesn't *excel* with markdown in the same ways.
> 
> Another popular alternative is [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). While I personally prefer obsidian (bigger user base means more community extensions, and I started there and so am acclimated), Logseq is open source, whereas obsidian is not. Further more, Logseq seems to be more privacy focused, but I couldn't say whether this claim is true or false without more information, though being OSS definitely lends it credibility. DYOR naturally.

The project is heavily informed by the [second brain](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/) movement. Accordingly one potential secondary function is to serve as a template that can be used by others.

There is a tertiary objective, and in a sense it is the primary objective. With this I mean to say: although obsidian is an excellent piece of software, it is also not the perfect tool to address the points articulated earlier. It is after all - a markdown editor.

Accordingly this project (rokosphoenix) is necessarily flawed in a number of ways, and so the tertiary/primary purpose is to lay the groundwork for a far more rigorous research and software development initiative, but this is also sort of a different project, so I won't cover it in detail on this page. Some more info on it is included in the callout below.

> [!info]- Planned R&D Initiative
> First, what is the objective of the initiative? Simply put: to create a piece of software that *really* acts as a proper second brain, and ideally a decentralized cybernetic one at that. Ideally we wouldn't just want a "second brain" that functions basically as fancy information retrieval tool for your digital memory, but a true second brain that enhances your (and humanities) ability to learn, plan, execute on objectives, and find truth - by orders of magnitude, *without diminishing the native cognitive capabilities of the humans involved, and instead preferably enhancing them.*
> 
> Obsidian may be the best *existing* tool for the job (or at least in the top three), but I believe a new tool must to be created - one that is far more comprehensive and rigorous. Granted, such a tool would no longer be a text editor, that would just be dependent feature of the tool, not its primary functionality.
> 
> Naturally, it's currently a work in progress, but at some point soon more information on this initiative will be added to the [[project > ophanim|ophanim]] page.
