Thanks for visiting. The site will be sparse for the immediate future. Optimally, everything will be based around an [[atom|atomic]] framework.

The [[navi|navigation]] page has some useful tips, header art is generated with [midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com), and the site is hosted by [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) publish. Feedback, questions, and suggestions can be submitted on the [discussions](https://github.com/harttraveller/rokosphoenix/discussions) page.

Key index pages are listed below.

- [[index.article|article]] -> published articles
- [[index.develop|develop]] -> developer projects
- [[index.project|project]] -> other projects
- [[index.purpose|purpose]] -> systematic framework
- [[index.venture|venture]] -> ongoing ventures
