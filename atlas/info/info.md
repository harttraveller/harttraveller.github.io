## Description
### Thought Experiment
As a thought experiment, suppose that people are crucibles for the recombination of information. That is to say: we ingest cultural, technological, sensory, etc. data, permute it, and then release it back out into the world, such that the process can repeat and refine itself over time. If this were the case, then I suppose what this site intends to do is to capture that process for this particular entity (me).

### BIT Framework
The framework I'm using for this site could be abbreviated as `BIT` - as there are three primary directories: `brain`, `input`, and `think`. The `brain` dir contains ontological structure information that can be used for traversing the graph. The `input` dir contains logs of input information. The `think` dir contains output information, or in less abstract terms: stuff I write or create.

### Completion Status
Note those pages may range from near complete articles, to stream of consciousness notes, to empty pages created as a reminder to fill in the page later. The [[#Status Tags|status tags]] heading below has more information on this point.

## Navigation

Note that if a shortcut doesn't work, clicking the page and trying the key again might solve the issue.

### Graph
The site is organized on a graph. You can hit the `:` key on your keyboard to toggle the local graph - to see the pages connected to the one you are currently on. This can also be used to reveal hidden connections. The `'` key - right of the the local graph key - can be used to toggle the global graph.

### File Browser
The `/` key toggles the quick search and file browser. Note that clicking a page in the file browser will not exit the file browser; it is necessary to hit the `/` key a second time. This is maintained as a feature to enable page previewing.

### Status Tags
Each page in the `input` or `think` directories ought to have a tag starting with either `input` or `think` (depending on which directory it is in). These tags are in turn divided into several subcategories. 

> [!info]- Tag Subcategories
> - past -> stuff in the past
> 	- archive -> stuff I don't intend to reference
> 	- reference -> stuff that may be a useful reference
> - present -> stuff currently worked on
> 	- focus -> primary focus of efforts
> 	- active -> generally active development
> - future -> stuff to work on in the future
> 	- priority -> priority items
> 	- backlog -> backlogged items
