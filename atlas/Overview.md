## Resources
Header art is generated with [midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com), and the site is hosted by [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) publish. Feedback, questions, and suggestions can be submitted via linked reddit threads, or alternatively via the [discussions](https://github.com/harttraveller/rokosphoenix/discussions) page.

## Completion
None of the work on the site is ever really complete - I intend to revise it continuously. With that said, particularly *incomplete* stuff is in the `local` directory in the repository.

## Atomics
The site uses an atomic framework; creating pointers to unique ideas instead of rearticulating them should reduce information redundancy.
