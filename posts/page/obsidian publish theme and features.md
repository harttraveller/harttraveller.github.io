# Description

This page has some loose documentation for the obsidian publish theme, and features used on this site. I'm probably going to continually adjust it as I find small improvements here or there. 

# Features

In the interest of time, I've only listed the keyboard shortcuts. I'd be happy to add detailed documentation if there is demand, but otherwise it wouldn't be a prudent use of time. If you would benefit from this, feel free to submit a [GitHub](https://github.com/harttraveller/rokosphoenix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) issue.

- `/` -> toggle quick search
- `;` -> toggle local graph
- `'` -> toggle global graph
- `[` -> toggle file browser
- `]` -> toggle table of contents

Also, right now the theme is customized more or less exactly to how I set up this site. I can create a generalizable version, but again - subject to demand.

# Dependencies

You'll need to have a [custom](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Set+up+a+custom+domain) domain for this to work, I think. I've only tested the theme with the [[#Settings|settings]] listed at the bottom of the page, so it may not work with other settings.

# Installation

You can use the theme by copying the [publish.css](https://github.com/harttraveller/rokosphoenix/blob/main/publish.css) and [publish.js](https://github.com/harttraveller/rokosphoenix/blob/main/publish.js) files into the home directory of your obsidian publish site.

# Notes

The animation is a gif, but was created with [this](https://codepen.io/harttraveller/pen/gOjyXdL) code. That code was in turn forked from [this](https://codepen.io/iMax723/pen/jWgLGg) codepen.
