The beauty of this objective is that it is a wonderful stroke of self-complete circular logic that is both the "uncaused cause" and not; and yet is still free from paradox.

If the "Truth" is an object made of information that has within it, and by its very nature is - the answer to all questions, then in order for it to be "True" it must contain the answer to itself. If it does, then it is complete. Such an object justifies its own existence. Whether or not there is something outside the object, the object itself contains a representation, or answer, as to why that is or is not the case.

Accordingly the object is itself an infinite regress of itself, but it is also not. What is at the bottom of the stack of turtles? The object has the answer. Why does this stack of turtles exist? The object has the answer. Why does the object have the answer? The object has the answer. Every answer is contained within it, thus it has within it - itself. Yet because it contains all answers, it is singular, and complete, and there is there is no need for "another turtle" below the object to justify its existence.

Strangely, while we cannot know the object, awareness of the object allows us to know it. The Truth is both a question, and an answer to all questions, and a workable definition for the meaning of life.

Put simply:

*What is the objective?*

To find the truth.

*What is the truth?*

You need to find the truth to know.

*Why is that the goal?*

You need to find the truth to know.

*Should that be the goal?*

You need to find the truth to know.

*What if that is not the goal?*

You need to find the truth to know.


*What if there is no Truth, or the truth does not matter?*

You need to find the truth to know.

*What if this entire page is actually baseless pseudo-philosophical hogwash?*

That may be the case, but you need to find the truth to know.

If the answer isn't "find the truth", then you need to find the truth to know this is the case. That's all there really is to it. And if that isn't, well then guess what you need to do?

It is simultaneously immutable and intractably mutable. Can you know the truth? I will leave that question in the air, but the course of action one should take seems clear.

I would offer a conjecture, that itself may or may not be true (I would need to find the truth), that any model of "Truth" you or I create is a necessarily imperfect representation of the "True Truth".

Accordingly, our own Truths (reality models), which are all we ever have, are not only mutable but intrinsically dynamic, necessarily subject to constant evolution and change. Perhaps we can never know the Truth, because perhaps it does not exist, but to say that carries no weight whatsoever unless one attempts to find it, and show it (the statement that there is no truth) is the case.

In this way, the Truth is mutable in a subjective sense - as a theoretical object, yet immutable as an abstraction. In a way, it is akin to a philosophical singularity - as we cannot escape from being pulled towards it. After all, the very act of investing energy to escape it necessarily pulls you closer to it. Can we reach it? This remains to be seen (perhaps, because of course, perhaps it does not remain to be seen, and we have already seen it).
