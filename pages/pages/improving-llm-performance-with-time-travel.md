or, formally, memory rewrites via context modification

when I think, I start down a path of thought, but than can revert to an earlier point and continue from their

system, memorize:
- facts
- ! deadends - sequences of tokens that led to dead ends
    - we don't want to memorize the whole idea that led to a dead end, because the actual idea isn't being represented, we want to memorize the seed that generated a rotten apple so we avoid going down that branch again
