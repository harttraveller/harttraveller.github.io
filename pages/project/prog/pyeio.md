# Overview
This is a python package for easy data input and output operations.

# Purpose
I've spent a lot of time rewriting snippets of code to load in different file formats. I find it is almost always faster to rewrite the code than find wherever you put it before. I figured I'd just centralize that functionality in one location and write some logic to handle disk IO operations on the backend.
