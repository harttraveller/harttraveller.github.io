The is a short post that sounds like its about programming, but is actually about memetics.

Over the last few years, what I thought was hatred of Russia crystalized in my mind. This is to say that any time 



Doesn't extend to inviduals.




??? question "Why so hateful?"
    I think I can identify two concrete and one abstract instances that spawned this.

    Kid with his head ripped apart. Drone footage of families being pulled out of their car and raped/killed. The general fact that not only is every time I've heard of russia over the last few years it is in respect to new bombings, innocents killed, but also the fact that Russian society seems to have been so willing in general to go along with a pointless war driven by a man who seems to be equal parts sociopath and autistic history nerd. The widespread spineless bothers me on a deep level. It is foreshadowing the most important part of this article, but I think that part of the reason this bothers me so much is because I also see the exact same cowardace within myself - which I would guess is probably where we should all start when [destroying the things we hate in the world - evaluating ourselves first to see if we are directing a hatred or guilt out of our own mind onto some external object or entity].

Hating russia

not actually hating russia, hating the thing

why - killed children, growing up, nana, pushkin and matryoshka dolls mix of backgrounds

There are a few gaffes made by officials in the current administration which have been roundly mocked, but which I think should not have been. The first was the presidents "I have a concept of a plan" statement - which I've since added to my personal lexicon. After all, I too often only have a concept of plan (don't we all?).[^2]

The second - and more relevant - is the "we are not at war with Iran, we are at war with Iran's nuclear reactors" statement by the vice president. Granted, in a practical political sense it is difficult to be only at war with another countries nuclear reactors, but not the country itself.

I think perhaps the danger lies in when we mistake the symbol that is correlated with the thing we hate for the thing we hate itself. 


I don't hate Russia, I hate "the-thing-that-makes-spineless-russian-diplomats-attend-a-faux-diplomatic-meeting-to-draw-out-a-pointless-war"

iran, russia, china, north korea, we shouldn't treat this as spin or mangled semantics for optics purposes, we should generally consider our objectives not to be the destruction or subservience of other peoples or states, but rather the destruction of the often unnamed structures and systems that persist in the shadows of our minds as individuals and societies, 

Most importantly, we should do this not only to avoid perpetuating pointless suffering in the world, but because the first place we might want to start when eradicating these foes is ourselves. Is not the hate I feel that very thing I seek to eradicate in the world? 


Another examples is with police who abuse their authority...
