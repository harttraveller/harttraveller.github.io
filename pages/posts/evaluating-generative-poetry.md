Random experiments with generative poetry and attempting to write executable poem.

<!-- more -->

I recently watched the video: [The Hellish Landscape of Published AI Poetry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ6xor2SLNU). The author asserts that AI generated poetry falls short of human poetry. If the value of poetry is derived in part by its nature as a human created entity, then by definition AI generated poetry will always fall short, no matter how beautiful? Perhaps, however, the generative poetry showcased in the video does unambiguously suck.

In fairness, most of the models criticized in the video were fairly old, so I thought it would be fair to test some of the newer models, and ended up trying to write an executable poem. I loved the results so much that I felt compelled to publish them somewhere - hence, this post.

## Proompt Engineering

I started with the following:

> Can you write a poem in the style of mark twain about the fact that every answer seems to generate more questions?

Which resulted in:

!!! quote "The Endless Inquiry"

    I set about to find the truth, to answer every query.

    But with each mystery solved, forsooth, new questions made me weary!

    From science to philosophy, from history to art,

    Each answer spawned perplexity, and tore my mind apart.

    The more I learned, the less I knew, socratic paradox.

    Enlightenment was but a ruse, a never-ending box.

    Alas, I am no wiser now than when I first began.

    The quest for knowledge anyhow confounds this humble man.

    But still I seek, I ponder yet, curiosity my master.

    Though answers bring no sure mindset, the journey is what matters.

The result is a little bit cliche of course, but I found it to be substantially better and more interesting than the examples in the original video. As with all such models, generating interesting variants is straightforward. Several variants are included below.

??? quote "Variant 1: The Endless Abyss"

    > Can you modify this poem, keeping the style of mark twain, but also mix in some of the existential terror that might be embodied in a beksinski painting?

    I sought the truth, a noble quest, but answers brought no peace.

    Each revelation, a behest, of horrors to release.

    In twisted landscapes of the mind, where logic's light is slain,

    I wander, lost, and hope to find a truth that's not insane.

    The more I learn, the less I know, the void consumes my soul.

    In Beksinski's world, all shadows grow, and dread takes full control.

    Grotesque forms lurk in every nook, their whispers taunt and tease.

    I dare not take a closer look, lest madness me seize.

    The quest for knowledge, once so bright, now leads to dark despair.

    In this bleak realm, there is no right, just anguish and nightmare.

    But still, I press on through the gloom, compelled by some strange force.

    Though answers lead to certain doom, I stay the morbid course.


??? quote "Variant 2: The Endless Exploration"
    
    > Great, now can you modify it, again keeping the style of mark twain, but instead of beksinski, try to embody the feeling given by a painting by pascal campion, and the humanistic optimism of carl rogers, abraham maslow, and viktor frankl?

    I ventured forth, a seeker true, in search of wisdom's light.

    Though answers oft were far and few, my hope remained in sight.

    In worlds where warmth and kindness reign, and hues of love abound,

    I found that through life's joy and pain, my spirit's strength was found.

    The more I sought, the more I grew, embracing all mankind.

    For in each soul, a truth we knew: Potential, unconfined.

    By looking deep within our hearts, we find the power to rise.

    In every end, a new start, and courage never dies.

    Though questions lead to mystery, the journey is the key.

    The growth we make, the love we see, are life's true victory.

    So onward I will bravely roam, with wonder as my guide.

    For in this quest, I've found my home, where joy and peace abide.

## An Executable Poem?

These were pretty good, and got me thinking about how you could write a python script that functions both as an executable script, and is itself a poem or work of art. I tried to get claude to write something, with mixed results.

??? code "Meh Script"

    > OK. I'm having a great time and really enjoying reading your poems. For context, I'm a machine learning engineer. Here's a fun creative challenge I'm curious to explore with you: do you think you can write a poem in valid python code, that explores this idea of seeking truth a la mark twain poems you wrote - but in a way such that the meaning of the poem is implied by the code - which when executed, provides some output/answer that completes the poem, referencing itself, and elucidating the underlying structure of this neverending search for truth?

    ```python
    def seek_truth(questions, answers=None):
        """
        A quest for truth, in code enshrined,
        Where questions lead and answers hide.
        """
        if answers is None:
            answers = {}

        for question in questions:
            if question not in answers:
                answers[question] = seek_truth(generate_questions(question), answers)

        return answers

    def generate_questions(answer):
        """
        From each answer, new questions spring,
        A fractal growth, a curious thing.
        """
        return [f"What if {answer}?", f"Why {answer}?", f"How {answer}?"]

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        initial_question = "What is truth?"
        truth_quest = seek_truth([initial_question])

        print("In seeking truth, a journey starts,")
        print("With questions posed, like hopeful darts.")
        print("Each answer found, a brief respite,")
        print("Before new queries come to light.")
        print()
        print("The search goes on, forever more,")
        print("A recursive quest, a code-borne lore.")
        print("For in this self-referential game,")
        print("The truth and code are one and same.")
        print()
        print(f"The answers found, a nested maze:")
        print(truth_quest)
    ```

This is a neat idea, but doesn't actually create very meaningful outputs. After a few other unsatisfying variants, I decided to just copy the code and manually adapt it myself using langchain and the OpenAI API.

The idea with this script is that it runs forever, executing the following loop:

1. Ask what some entity (eg: reality) is, in the style of some artist/author/poet.
2. Take the answer and grab some new word from it.
3. Repeat from step 1 with some new author/artists style.

The general idea is that script - having no stopping condition or ending point - serves as a sort of work of art itself. Ideally it is a "poem as code that as an executed program also generates poetry". That was the ideal at least, though I definitely fell short of it. Right now, the script is more just like a script that generates poetic quotes, though I'm sure with some creative refactoring and variable renaming you could make the code itself resemble something more artsy.

That said, the perfect is the enemy of the good, and I'd rather just publish this and then let others make of it what they will than sit on it indefinitely.

Even though it didn't work perfectly, I'm quite satisfied with the results! I've included the full logs before I terminated the program. I was in a rush and forgot to log which author's style was being invoked, but in retrospect now that information is lost, perhaps it makes it more interesting to try and guess. Many of the styles are ambiguous, but some are obvious.

## Program Logs

Again, it didn't work perfectly. The reader is free to adapt use/adapt the script or this idea however they see fit of course. Before switching to GPT4, I tested the program with Mistrals 8x7b MoE model as well. That didn't work quite as well, but I did get this one quote which I really loved from that model, before it went off the rails:

!!! quote "What is reality?"
    Reality, my dear friend, is but a mirage dancing in the desert of human perception, a curious blend of fact and fancy that's ever shifting like sands beneath our weary feet.

I've included some of my favorites below, though honestly it was hard to choose. So many of these ended up great. I'm not sure why there is such a heavy focus on "threads", "weaving", and "labyrinths" - but it strangely fits as these are objects I personally invoke in a metaphorical sense all the time. There are also some ones I found funny/very easy to identify which author was the stylistic foundation for the quote - a few of these are marked too.

### Decent Results

!!! quote "Humanity"
    Humanity, a quilt of myriad souls stitched with the thread of desires and dreams, frayed by sorrows, yet ever-expanding in the grasp of our shared, unyielding hope.

!!! quote "Gentle"
    In a world where brute force is often king, gentle is the quiet, unassuming power that whispers of decency in the face of tyranny.

!!! quote "Soul"
    A soul, an indomitable flicker of consciousness, dances through the labyrinth of our inner cosmos, weaving through the tapestry of thoughts, memories, and desires, that shimmering essence which defies the boundaries of time and space, and to which we are forever trying to stitch the scattered fragments of our existence.

!!! quote "Fate"
    Fate is a well-stitched tapestry of intricate threads, some frayed, some taut, each intertwined by the hands of a silent and indifferent clockmaker.

!!! quote "Rocket"
    In the damp and darkened chambers of her mind, she conjured the image of the rocket, a slender tower of ambition and precision, piercing the heavens in a fiery ascent towards the stars, a symbol of mankind's insatiable quest for dominion over the vast, indifferent cosmos.

!!! quote "Marvel"
    Marvel is the delicate interplay of life’s tapestry, a moment’s exquisite bloom amid the prosaic, where the heart, in silent reverence, acknowledges the sublime.

!!! quote "Giants"
    In the absurd theater of existence, giants are but men inflated by the myths of their own making, towering over us not in stature but in the echoes of their solitude.

!!! quote "Harmony"
    In the dim, smoky room where the light of truth flickers just out of reach, harmony is the elusive symphony of the soul's accord, played out in the grand, divine comedy of life, where each note falls into place as if willed by the Master's hand.

!!! quote "Peace"
    Peace, in its elusive splendor, is like holding your breath in the eye of a hurricane, knowing the world's crazy and all, but still finding that one spot where everything's just still.

!!! quote "Transcend"
    In the labyrinth of my own existence, where shadows of past selves flicker and intertwine, transcendence emerges as the elusive moment in which I, shedding the skin of who I was, step into the blinding light of who I might become.

!!! quote "Tempests"
    Tempests are, if you will—and one does well to imagine them as such—these roiling, frenetic ballets of atmospheric tumult, where the sky, not content with mere placidity, erupts into this chaotic symphony of winds and rain, a meteorological maelstrom that, in its unbridled fury, both terrifies and mesmerizes, revealing in its vortex the raw and untamed dance of nature's own volatile temper.

!!! quote "Dread"
    Dread's the creeping, seeping fear that withers one's peace, a yellow wallpaper enclosing 'round the mind with no release.

!!! quote "Identity"
    A tapestry of self, both inward and outward spun, where tales and truths dance under life's ever-changing sun.

!!! quote "Truth"
    In the labyrinth of human existence, truths are the slender threads we clutch at, hoping to find our way out, only to discover they are part of the maze itself.

### Identifiable Results

!!! quote "Morality"
    A complex tapestry, woven with threads of right and wrong, that guides us through life's twisting corridors, much like the ever-shifting staircases of Hogwarts.

!!! quote "Zephyr"
    In the world of Greg Heffley, a zephyr's just a fancy word for wind that'd mess up my hair on school picture day.

!!! quote "Quietude"
    Quietude's that soft jazz silence in the soul's back pocket, where the world's hustle fades into a cool whisper of solitude, man.

!!! quote "Unmarred"
    Unmarred is a spotless spot, a perfect thing where flaws are not!

!!! quote "Sustenance"
    Sustenance is, fundamentally, anything that hitches a ride through the galactic gullet to fuel the farcical escapade that life insists on performing, often with a side of tea.

!!! quote "Bob"
    Bob's the name that echoes in the vast and vestigial void, borne on the wind of forgotten realms and etched into the very marrow of the world, a moniker as old as time and as enigmatic as the silence between stars.

In the vast, velvet void where silent stars dance with divine indifference, cosmic is the ethereal enigma, an infinite waltz of worlds unseen, a grandeur so profound it whispers to our souls in the language of the sublime and the sacred.

What is "divine"?

In counterpoint of cosmic score, divine the harmony of spheres, where notes celestial do align, and music of the heavens clears.

What is harmony?

In the dim, smoky room where the light of truth flickers just out of reach, harmony is the elusive symphony of the soul's accord, played out in the grand, divine comedy of life, where each note falls into place as if willed by the Master's hand.

A sanctuary where whispers of the earth's deepest secrets are cradled in petals and leaves, serenaded by the wind's hushed lullabies.

What is "petals"?

Fragile whispers of nature's tender hands, they are the colored dreams of waking flora, dancing to the whims of the zephyr's breath.

What is whispers?

In dulcet tones, a zephyr's speech, a secret's tender, silent breach.
