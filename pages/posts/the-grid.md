A random thought that has been circling around in the back of my head for a while relating to the centrality of "the grid" to the dominance of Homo Sapiens on planet earth.

<!-- more -->

I don't think this post will make much sense, and it might even come off a bit schizophrenic, but here's the (very poorly substantiated) claim this article presents:

**The ability to conceive of and organize information on a grid is one of the key reasons 

## Orthotopes

Specifically, I'm referring to an orthotopic grid...

## What are the other reasons (human succeeded)?

## What is "the grid"?

Seeing like a state


Organize and locate information along coordinate axes - can't do excel spreadsheets with triangles or hexagons.

## Theory

Human communication, the ability for adaptive collective dissociation[^1]

[^1]: I might add a separate note on this later, but the TLDR is: when you see people use the word "we" - what are they referring to? "We" think that it is the interests "our" country/corporation/religion

So far, I haven't really provided any kind of formal or scientific proof of the claim. I don't really have any. What I will say is that it is mighty strange that the topology of the grid is *omnipresent* in human society, but *nowhere* to be found in nature. The closest that any other creature gets that I have yet seen is 

The ability to conceive of this topology and organize information on it - even cartesian coordinate systems (though more recent than the classical grid) are a refined example of this - the space the coordinate system is effectively a grid of arbitrarily small squares, cubes, or n-dimensional hypercubes found at the position we define with whatever coordinates we choose

## Examples

Let's compare examples of the grid outside of, and inside of human society. I couldn't actually find any examples of the grid outside human society.

The only example I found that is "grid-like" is the grid of hexagons created in bee hives. This doesn't even count though, because (1) those are hexagons not squares, and, to a lesser extent (2) because the hexagonal shapes are an emergent property of efficient packing in the hive, and (presumably) not explicitly planned by the bees. Point (2) is weaker though because it's conceivable that bees could have some kind of pseudo-coordinate system to operate on a
