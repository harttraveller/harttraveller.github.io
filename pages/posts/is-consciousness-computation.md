Or rather, does computation "generate" consciousness? For various reasons, I'm inclined to believe that it does, but I also have what I think is a fairly solid mathematical argument for why it can't, and I actively want to find flaws in the logic of this argument to get to the bottom of this.

## LMK

I am looking for flaws in the logic. In some cases there may be premises I assume to be self-evident, but if they don't seem to be then LMK. If you find a flaw or have a criticism, even better - email me at:

## Context

**Why do I want to believe that consciousness generates computation?**

- If it did, there is a clear path for getting closer to an answer for the [hard problem](https://iep.utm.edu/hard-problem-of-conciousness/).
- If consciousness could be digitized that would facilitate interstellar travel.
- The available alternatives are unfalsifiable, unactionable, and/or degenerate into circular logic.

Note that this article doesn't present an answer for where consciousness/qualia come from, it only presents an argument for why it wouldn't come from computation.

**Consciousness vs. Intelligence**

I should also establish that consciousness != intelligence, I assume you would assume I've assumed this premise, but still may as well point it out. While there aren't any great definitions of either, imperfect definitions off the top of my head are:

*Intelligence*

Given some objective, intelligence is the ability to acquire, retrieve, and process information to reach that objective. The "generality" of intelligence refers to the diversity of environments that can be handled to reach objectives.

*Consciousness*

If Mary was locked in a monochrome room since birth and taught everything there was to know about the color blue, and then one day you let her out of the box, the thing that she would get from looking at the sky on a clear day that was never conveyed to her in the room is consciousness; it is something other than descriptive information about phenomena, it is the experience of them.

## Introduction

Why would we believe that consciousness generates computation? Let's do a quick recap of neuroanatomy. In your brain, there are ~80 billion neurons.

Here is a diagram of a neuron:

...

And here's the TLDR on how a neuron works.

To propagate a signal, the ion pumps in the wall of an axon open, allowing ions to flow through. This changes the electric charge differential between the inside and the outside of the axon. This charge differential propagates down the axon until it reaches the synapse, wherein either excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters are released into the synapse and bind to the next neuron. Excitatory neurotransmitters increase the probability the next neuron will also fire, and inhibitory neurotransmitters decrease the probability.

Here is how we could model a neuron:


Let's assume that this mechanism of action is all that is necessary to model a neuron. It might not be, but that doesn't change the substance of the argument as long as the way it which it isn't can be reduced to a computational process.


## Thought Experiments

Suppose we took your brain (modeled below, other neurons omitted for brevity):

![[brain-model-1.drawio.svg]]

And we spread out the neurons so they were all a little bit further apart from each other in your head, like so:

![[brain-model-2.drawio.svg]]

Everything else continues to function normally, but perhaps it takes you a millisecond longer to choose what to have for lunch or something. Presumably, you're still conscious.

OK, now suppose some type 3 civilization comes down an pushes this experiment to the limit. They take each neuron in your brain and spread it out across a volume such that each neuron is a minimum of one light year from every other neuron. They maintain the structure of your brain, and the infrastructure to support normal operation, and feed in sensory information that perfectly replicates the sensory information your organs were providing you before, operating the system for a very long time.

![[brain-model-stellar-1.drawio.svg]]

It might take a long time for you to form a thought, but the computational processes and the medium in which they occur are the same. Presumably, you're sitll conscious.

<!-- This is where the first flaw in the argument could be. Perhaps in order for something to be conscious, the specific computational steps associated with experience must be performed within a tightly bounded region of space, time, or spacetime - though that would be strange. -->

OK, now let's suppose that the type 3 civ replaces all the kinesin proteins that transport neurotransmitters.

It may seem like I'm leading up to re-explain the ship of theseus or something, but I'm not. I'm simply making the point that in the field of cognitive science and neuroscience there is broad agreement that:

**1. Computation is medium independent.**

Whether monkeys or neurons it doesn't matter, the process is the same.

**2. Computation is isomorphic across arbitrary domains of space and time.**

It doesn't matter 

**3. The computational processes that occur in the brain are responsible for consciousness.**

Some finicky neuroscientists might say that I'm claiming something about their opinion overconfidently, perhaps they would say that we can observe strong correlation between the computational processes in the brain and conscious states, but that doesn't imply causation (or something like that).

Perhaps I am, but the intent of this article is precisely to show that this statement must be false, and it is useful as an assumed prior, plus folks do tend to believe this anyways.

On that note: these are the assumed priors for the argument. Given these assumed priors, I will demonstrate they mathematically imply 


<!-- If you take issue with them (as I will later on) - [[#LMK]]! I'd be especially curious about the formal reasoning of your disagreement. -->

<!-- OK so now suppose we repeat this, except instead we increase the distance a lot. -->


<!-- medium independent computation -->

<!-- some thought experiments, stretching out neurons, adding repeaters, adding noise, replicating the process in an absurd circumstance (monkeys) -->

<!-- what is computation - causally connected sequence of events - ref wolframs principle of computational equivalence -->

<!-- our perception of structure is a process by which we filter out noise we deem to be irrelevant - but that isn't irrelevant or relevant to the objective computation, all that is occurring are state changes in a particular sequence -->


## Implication

Let's start from the premise that computation does generate consciousness, where does that lead us?
