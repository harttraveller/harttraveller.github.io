# Overview

In the interest of providing a common resource for:

- Myself (to organize my thoughts)
- Family and friends (who have asked about it)
- Anyone else (who may find it useful)

# Sections

I intend to add several sections to this page, short descriptions are included below.

1. [[#Introduction]] -> A high level introduction to the software.

# Introduction

Obsidian is a graph based markdown editor. If you are familiar with VSCode, a good metaphor to describe it might be: "The VSCode for text that isn't code". Some of its benefits include its price (or lack thereof), customizability, extensibility, and its ability to adapt to a wide variety of usecases.

> [!note]- Obsidian Price
> The software is free for individual users. There are some paid services offered by the company like obsidian sync and obsidian publish, and some community contributed plugins connect to paid APIs.

> [!warning]- Obsidian Customization
> The high customizability could be a benefit insofar as it is both (A) fun, and (B) allows you to increase productivity, however, you may spend more time streamlining your workflow than actually getting work done. It's important to be wary of this...



2. [[#Resources]] -> A collection of resources and links that may be useful.
3. [[#Software]] -> More detailed and potentially useful software information.
4. [[#Features]] -> Information about built in features and settings.
5. [[#Plugins]] -> Plugins overview, recommendations, and configuration.
6. [[#Workflow]] -> Personal workflows I've found useful and use or am developing.
7. [[#Notes]] -> Assorted notes that either stand alone or I plan to integrate.

If you prefer to stick with VSCode, [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) and [dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so/) are popular alternatives. There are definitely benefits to these, as VSCode has the most and best extensions - the caveat being that it is a *code* editor, and so while it works fine for markdown (and is better for some specific purposes, like mkdocs sites), it doesn't *excel* with markdown in the same ways.

Another popular alternative is [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). While I personally prefer obsidian (bigger user base means more community extensions, and I started there and so am acclimated), Logseq is open source, whereas obsidian is not. Further more, Logseq seems to be more privacy focused, but I couldn't say whether this claim is true or false without more information, though being OSS definitely lends it credibility. DYOR naturally.
